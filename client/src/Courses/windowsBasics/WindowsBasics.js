                <h3>All about Windows</h3>
                <p>Windows is an <strong>operating system</strong> designed by Microsoft. The operating system is what allows you to use a computer. Windows comes <strong>preloaded</strong> on most new personal computers (PCs), which helps to make it the most popular operating system in the world.</p>
                <p>Windows makes it possible to complete all types of <strong>everyday tasks</strong> on your computer. For example, you can use Windows to browse the Internet, check your email, edit digital photos, listen to music, play games, and do much more. <br /></p>

                <p>Windows is also used in many offices because it gives you access to <strong>productivity tools</strong> such as calendars, word processors, and spreadsheets. <br /></p>
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/allaboutwindows_planner.jpg" alt="Microsoft Word" title="Microsoft Word" /></div>
                <p>Microsoft released the first version of Windows in the mid-1980s. There have been many versions of Windows since then, but the most recent ones include <strong>Windows 10</strong> (released in 2015), <strong>Windows 8 </strong>(2012), <strong>Windows 7</strong> (2009), <strong>Windows Vista </strong>(2007), and <strong>Windows XP </strong>(2001).</p>
                <h4>About this tutorial</h4>
                <p>This tutorial is designed to show you the <strong>absolute basics of using a Windows computer</strong>, including how to use the desktop, how to open different files and applications, and how to move and resize windows. The information in this tutorial will apply to more recent versions of Windows, including the ones mentioned above. However, once you've learned the basics, you may also want to review one of our <strong>version-specific</strong> <strong>Windows tutorials</strong>. Just select the version of Windows that's installed on your computer:</p>

                </ul>
                <h4>Windows 8 vs. other versions</h4>
                <p>While most versions of Windows are relatively similar, Windows 8 works <strong>very differently</strong> from other versions. However, if you have Windows 8 on your computer, you should now be able to upgrade to Windows 10, which is more similar to earlier versions, including Windows 7. We recommend upgrading your computer to Windows 10 if you can. Review our <a target="_self" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windows10">Windows 10 tutorial</a> to learn how.</p>
                <p>However, we'll still point out any <strong>major</strong> <strong>differences</strong> between Windows 8 and other versions, which means you'll see some Windows 8-specific information from time to time. If your computer uses Windows 8, you'll want to review both this tutorial and our <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windows8" target="_self">Windows 8</a> tutorial to learn more about the differences.</p>

            <h3>Working with applications</h3>
            <p>An <strong>application</strong>—also known as a <strong>program</strong>—is a type of software that allows you to <strong>complete</strong> <strong>tasks</strong> on your computer. Windows comes with many built-in applications you can use. For example, if you want to browse the Internet, you can use<strong> Microsoft Edge</strong><strong> </strong>(or <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>Explorer</strong> if you're using Windows 8 or earlier).</p>
            <h4>To open an application:</h4>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                Using your mouse, click the <strong>Start</strong> button, then select the desired application. If you don't see the one you want, click <strong>All Programs</strong> to see a complete list of applications. In our example, we'll open<strong> Microsoft Edge</strong>.
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/navigatingwindows_startbutton2.jpg" alt="start button in Windows 10" title="start button in Windows 10" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                The application will appear in a <strong>new window</strong>. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/navigatingwindows_edgewindow.jpg" alt="Microsoft Edge new window" title="Microsoft Edge new window" /></div>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="moreInfo">There is no Start menu in Windows 8, so you'll usually open applications from the <strong>Start screen</strong>. Click the Start button to go to the Start screen, then click an app to open it.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/ie_open.jpg" alt="screenshot of Windows 8" width={160} height={161} /></div>
            <h3>Working with windows</h3>
            <p>Whenever you open a file, folder, or application, it will appear in a <strong>new</strong> <strong>window</strong>. You can have multiple items open at the same time in different windows. You'll use windows all the time, so it's important to know how to switch between open windows, how to move and resize windows, and how to close windows when you're done using them.</p>
            <p className="attention">In Windows 8, some programs will open on the Start screen, not the desktop. If you're using Windows 8, note that the information below applies only to windows you have opened on the desktop.</p>
            <h4>Parts of a window</h4>
            <p>You'll see the same three buttons in the upper-right corner of almost every window. These buttons allow you to perform several functions, including these below.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong />Click the <strong>Minimize</strong> button to <strong>hide the window</strong>. The window will be minimized to the taskbar. You can then click the icon for that window on the taskbar to make it reappear.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/nav_minimize.jpg" alt="Minimize button" title="Minimize button" /></div>
                <strong />
              </li>
              <li>
                Click the <strong>Maximize</strong> button to <strong>make the window fill the entire screen</strong>.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/nav_maximize.jpg" alt="Maximize button" title="Maximize button" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                If the screen is maximized, the Maximize button will be temporarily replaced by the <strong>Restore</strong> button. Just click it to return the window to its original size.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/nav_restore.jpg" alt="Restore button" title="Restore button" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Click the <strong>Close</strong> button to <strong>close</strong> the window.

            <h4>To move a window:</h4>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                Click and drag the top of the window to move it to the desired location on the screen. When you're done, release the mouse.&nbsp;

            </ol>
            <h4>To resize a window:</h4>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                Hover the mouse over any <strong>corner</strong> of the window, then click and drag the mouse to make the window larger or smaller. When you're done, release the mouse.

              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Switching between windows</h4>
            <p>If you have more than one window open at the same time, you can quickly switch between them by clicking the <strong>icon</strong> for that window on the taskbar.</p>
            <h3>Shutting down your computer</h3>
            <p>When you're done using your computer, it's important to <strong>shut it down properly</strong>. The procedure will vary slightly depending on which version of Windows you're using.</p>
            <h4>To shut down your computer:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you're using  <strong>Windows 10</strong>, click the <strong>Start</strong> button, then the <strong>Power</strong> icon, then click <strong>Shut down</strong>.

            <h4>Restarting and Sleep mode</h4>
            <p>You can also click the <strong>power button</strong><strong /> button for more options. For example, if your computer has become unresponsive, you can choose <strong>Restart</strong> to quickly turn it off and on again.</p>
            <p>You can also choose to put your computer into <strong>Sleep mode</strong>. This turns off most of your computer's processes, but it remembers which applications and files are open. It allows the computer to <strong>start up more quickly </strong>because you won't have to wait for the operating system and applications to load. Note that your computer may go into Sleep mode <strong>automatically</strong> if you haven't used it for more than a few minutes. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/navigatingwindows_sleep.jpg" style={{width: 508, height: '254.883px'}} alt="Sleep mode in Windows 10" title="Sleep mode in Windows 10" width={508} height="254.88299999999998" /></div>

            <h3>Working with files</h3>
            <p>Understanding how to work with<strong> files and folders </strong>is an important part of using your computer. Once you understand how files and folder work, you'll use them all the time. In this lesson, we'll show you the<strong> absolute basics of working with files</strong>, including how to<strong> open</strong> <strong>files</strong>, <strong>move your files into folders</strong>, and <strong>delete</strong> <strong>files</strong>.</p>
            <p className="chevron">Watch the video below to learn more about using files and folders in Windows.</p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/BY1y_RQxIdg.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /><br /></div>
            <h4 className="clearfl">What is a file?</h4>
            <p>There are many different <strong>types</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>files</strong> you can use. For example, Microsoft Word documents, digital photos, digital music, and digital videos are all types of files. You might even think of a file as a <strong>digital version</strong> of a real-world thing you can interact with on your computer. When you use different applications, you'll often be <strong>viewing</strong>, <strong>creating</strong>, or <strong>editing files</strong>.</p>
            <p>Files are usually represented by an <strong>icon</strong>. In the image below, you can see a few different types of files below the Recycle Bin on the desktop. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_file_icons.jpg" style={{width: 442, height: 262}} alt="file icons in Windows 10" title="file icons in Windows 10" width={442} height={262} /></div>
            <h4>What is a folder?</h4>
            <p>Windows uses <strong>folders</strong> to help you organize files. You can put files <strong>inside</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>folder</strong>, just like you would put documents inside a real folder. In the image below, you can see some folders on the desktop. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_folders.jpg" style={{width: 331, height: '124.867px'}} alt="folders in Windows 10" title="folders in Windows 10" width={331} height="124.86699999999999" /></div>
            <h4>File Explorer</h4>
            <p>You can view and organize files and folders using a built-in application known as <strong>File Explorer</strong> (called <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> in Windows 7 and earlier versions).</p>
            <p>To open File Explorer, click the <strong>File Explorer</strong> icon on the taskbar, or double-click any folder on your desktop. A new File Explorer window will appear. Now you're ready to start working with your files and folders. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwith-files_file_explorer.jpg" alt="File Explorer" title="File Explorer" /></div>
            <p>From File Explorer,<strong> double-click a folder to open it</strong>. You can then see all of the files stored in that folder. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_documents_quick_access.jpg" alt="double-clicking a folder" title="double-clicking a folder" /></div>
            <p>Notice that you can also see the <strong>location</strong> of a folder in the <strong>address bar</strong> near the top of the window. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_address_bar.jpg" alt="location of the folder in the address bar" title="location of the folder in the address bar" /></div>
            <h4>To open a file:</h4>
            <p>There are two main ways to open a file:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Find the file on your computer and double-click it</strong>. This will open the file in its <strong>default application</strong>. In our example, we'll open a Microsoft Word document (<strong>Cover Letter.docx</strong>), which will open in <strong>Microsoft Word</strong>. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_open_file.jpg" alt="open a file by double-clicking it" title="open a file by double-clicking it" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Open the application, then use the application to open the file</strong>. Once the application is open, you can go to the <strong>File</strong> menu at the top of the window and select <strong>Open</strong>. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_open_recent_word.jpg" style={{width: 463, height: '464.55px'}} alt="open the application" title="open the application" width={463} height="464.54999999999995" /></div>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Moving and deleting files</h3>
            <p>As you begin using your computer, you will start to collect more and more files, which can make it more difficult to find the files you need. Fortunately, Windows allows you to <strong>move</strong> <strong>files</strong> to different folders and <strong>delete files</strong> you no longer use.</p>
            <h4>To move a file:</h4>
            <p>It's easy to move a file from one location to another. For example, you might have a file on the <strong>desktop</strong> that you want to move to your <strong>Documents</strong> folder.</p>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                Click and drag the file to the desired location.
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_move_file.jpg" alt="moving a file" title="moving a file" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Release the mouse. The file will appear in the new location. In this example, we have opened the folder to see the file in its new location. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_new_file_location.jpg" alt="file appears in the new location" title="file appears in the new location" /></div>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="moreInfo">You can use this same technique to<strong> move an entire folder</strong>. Note that moving a folder will also move all of the files within that folder.</p>
            <h4>To create a new folder:</h4>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                Within File Explorer, locate and select the <strong>New folder</strong> button. You can also <strong>right-click</strong> where you want the folder to appear, then select <strong>New &gt; Folder</strong>. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_new_folder.jpg" alt="new folder" title="new folder" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                The new folder will appear. Type the desired <strong>name</strong> for the folder and press <strong>Enter</strong>. In our example, we'll call it <strong>School Documents</strong>. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_rename_folder.jpg" alt="typing a new name for the folder" title="typing a new name for the folder" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>The new folder will be created. You can now move files into this folder.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>To rename a file or folder:</h4>
            <p>You can change the name of any file or folder. A unique name will make it easier to remember what type of information is saved in the file or folder.</p>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>Click the file or folder, <strong>wait</strong> <strong>about one second</strong>, and click again. An editable text field will appear.</li>
              <li>
                Type the desired name on your keyboard and press <strong>Enter</strong>. The name will be changed.

              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="moreInfo">You can also <strong>right-click</strong> the folder and select <strong>Rename</strong> from the menu that appears. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_rename_from_menu.jpg" alt="right-click to rename" title="right-click to rename" /></div>
            <h4>To delete a file or folder:</h4>
            <p>If you no longer need to use a file, you can delete it. When you delete a file, it is moved to the <strong>Recycle Bin</strong>. If you change your mind, you can move the file from the Recycle Bin back to its original location. If you're sure you want to permanently delete the file, you will need to <strong>empty the Recycle Bin</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Selecting multiple files</h3>
            <p>Now that you know the basics, here are a few tips to help you move your files even faster.</p>
            <h4>Selecting more than one file</h4>
            <p>There are a few ways to select <strong>more than one file at a time</strong>:<strong /></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you're viewing your files as icons, you can<strong> click and drag the mouse to draw a box</strong> around the files you want to select. When you're done, release the mouse; the files will be selected. You can now move, copy, or delete all of these files at the same time.

              </li>
              <li>
                To select <strong>specific</strong> <strong>files</strong> from a folder, press and hold the <strong>Control</strong> key on your keyboard, then click the files you want to select.

              </li>
              <li>
                To select a <strong>group of files</strong> from a folder, click the first file, press and hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key on your keyboard, then click the last file. All of the files between the first and last ones will be selected.

              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Selecting all files</h4>
            <p>If you want to select <strong>all files in a folder</strong> at the same time, open the folder in File Explorer and press <strong>Ctrl+A </strong>(press and hold the <strong>Control</strong> key on your keyboard, then press <strong>A</strong>). All of the files in the folder will be selected. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/workingwithfiles_select_all.jpg" alt="selecting all files" title="selecting all files" /></div>
            <p className="moreInfo">Ctrl+A is an example of a <strong>keyboard shortcut</strong>. We'll talk more about these in our lesson on <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows/1/" target="_self">Keyboard Shortcuts in Windows</a>.</p>
            <p>If working with files and folders feels a little tricky right now, don't worry! Like anything else, working with files and folders is largely a matter of practice. You'll start to feel more comfortable as you continue using your computer. In the <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/finding-files-on-your-computer/1/" target="_self">next lesson</a>, we'll talk about another important concept: <strong>how to find files</strong> on your computer that you can't easily locate.</p>
            <h3>Shortcuts</h3>
            <p>If you have a file or folder you use frequently, you can save time by creating a <strong>shortcut</strong> on the desktop. Instead of navigating to the file or folder each time you want to use it, you can simply double-click the shortcut to open it. A shortcut will have a small arrow in the lower-left corner of the icon.</p>
            <p>Note that creating a shortcut does <strong>not</strong> create a duplicate copy of the folder; it's simply a way to access the folder more quickly. If you delete a shortcut, it will not delete the actual folder or the files it contains. Also note that copying a shortcut onto a flash drive will not work; if you want to bring a file with you, you'll need to navigate to the actual location of the file and copy it to the flash drive.</p>
            <h4>To create a shortcut:</h4>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                Locate and right-click the desired folder, then select <strong>Send to Desktop (create shortcut)</strong>.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A shortcut to the folder will appear on the desktop. Notice the arrow in the lower-left corner of the icon. You can now double-click the shortcut to open the folder at any time. <br /></p>

              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="moreInfo">You can also hold the <strong>Alt</strong> key on your keyboard, then click and drag the folder to the desktop to create a shortcut.</p>

            <h3>Finding files on your computer</h3>
            <p>In the <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/working-with-files/1/" target="_self">previous lesson</a>, we talked about how folders can help to keep your files <strong>organized</strong>. However, there may be times when you have trouble<strong> finding a certain file</strong>. If this happens to you, don't panic! The file is probably still on your computer, and there are a few simple ways to find it. In this lesson, we'll show you different techniques you can use to find your files, including <strong>searching</strong> and looking in<strong> common places</strong>.</p>
            <p className="chevron">Watch the video below to learn more about finding files in Windows.</p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/GtGVItw89NM.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /><br /></div>
            <h4 className="clearfl">Common places to look for files</h4>
            <p>If you're having a difficult time finding a file, there's a good chance you can find it in one of the following places:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Downloads</strong>: By default, your computer will place downloaded files in a specific folder, known as the<strong> Downloads </strong>folder. If you're having trouble finding a file you downloaded from the Internet, such as a photo attached to an email message, this is the <strong>first place</strong> you should look. To view the Downloads folder, open <strong>File</strong> <strong>Explorer</strong>, then locate and select <strong>Downloads</strong> (below <strong>Favorites </strong>on the left side of the window). A list of your recently <strong>downloaded files</strong> will appear. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/findingfiles_downloads.jpg" alt="downloads folder" title="downloads folder" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Default folders</strong>: If you don't specify a location when saving a file, Windows will place certain types of files into default folders. For example, if you're looking for a Microsoft Word document, you could try looking in the <strong>Documents</strong> folder. If you're looking for a photo, try looking in the <strong>Pictures</strong> folder. Most of these folders will be accessible on the left side of the File Explorer window.
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/findingfiles_documents.jpg" alt="default folders like documents" title="default folders like documents" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Recycle Bin</strong>: If you deleted a file by mistake, it may still be in the Recycle Bin. You can double-click the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop to open it. If you find the file you need, click and drag it back to the desktop or to a different folder. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/findingfiles_recycle_bin.jpg" alt="recycle bin" title="recycle bin" /></div>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Searching for files</h3>
            <p>Let's say you recently downloaded a few photos that were attached to an email message, but now you're not sure where these files are on your computer. If you're struggling to find a file, you can always <strong>search</strong> <strong>for it</strong>. Searching allows you to look for <strong>any file</strong> on your computer.</p>
            <h4>To search for a file (Windows 10):</h4>
            <p>In the <strong>Search Box</strong> next to the Start button, type to search for a file. The search results will appear above the search box. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/findingfiles_search_box.jpg" alt="Search box" title="Search box" /></div>
            <h4>To search for a file (Windows 8):</h4>
            <p>Click the <strong>Start button</strong> to go to the <strong>Start screen</strong>, then start typing to search for a file. The search results will appear on the right side of the screen. Simply click a file or folder to open it.</p>

            <h4>To search for a file (Windows 7 and earlier):</h4>
            <p>Click the <strong>Start button</strong>, type the<strong> file name</strong> or <strong>keywords </strong>with your keyboard, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. The search results will appear. Simply click a file or folder to open it.</p>

            <h4>Tips for finding files</h4>
            <p>If you're still having trouble finding the file you need, here are some additional tips.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Try different search terms</strong>. If you're using the search option, try using different terms in your search. For example, if you're looking for a certain Microsoft Word document, try searching for a few different file names you might have used when saving the document.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Open the last application used to edit the file</strong>. If you know you used a certain application to edit a file, open that application and select <strong>File</strong><strong> &gt; Open &gt; Recent</strong> from the menu. The file may appear in the list of recently edited files. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/findingfiles_word.jpg" alt="Microsoft Word" title="Microsoft Word" /></div>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Move and rename the file after finding it</strong>. Once you've located the file, you may want to <strong>move it to a related folder</strong> so you can find it more easily in the future. For example, if the file is a picture, you might move it to your <strong> Pictures</strong> folder. You may also want to give it a file name that will be easy to remember. You can review our lesson on <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/working-with-files/1/" target="_self">Working with Files</a> to learn more about managing files.</li>

            <h3>Common computer tasks</h3>
            <p>Learning how to use a computer can feel overwhelming at times. Fortunately, there are some common computer skills that will <strong>work the same way</strong> in almost any situation. Once you learn how to use these skills, you'll be able to use them to perform a variety of tasks on your computer. In this lesson, we'll talk about some common commands you can use in almost any application, including <strong>cut</strong>, <strong>copy</strong>, <strong>paste</strong>, and <strong>undo</strong>.</p>
            <h3>The Menu bar</h3>
            <p>Most applications have a <strong>Menu</strong> <strong>bar</strong> at the top of the window. Each menu has a set of <strong>commands</strong> that will perform a specific action within the program. While each application is different, there are some common commands that<strong> work the same way</strong>, no matter which application you're using. Whenever you open a program for the first time, try clicking these menus to see the various options available.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/common_menu_bar.jpg" alt="Menu bar in Notepad" title="Menu bar in Notepad" /></div>
            <h4>File menu commands</h4>
            <p>You'll find the <strong>File</strong> menu on the leftmost side of the Menu bar in almost every application. The File menu will usually have the same type of commands. For example, you can create a <strong>new</strong> file, <strong>open</strong> an existing file, and <strong>save</strong> the current file, among other functions.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/common_file_menu.jpg" alt="File menu in WordPad" title="File menu in WordPad" /></div>
            <h3>Cut, copy, and paste</h3>
            <p>Many applications allow you to <strong>copy</strong> items from one place and then <strong>paste </strong>them to another. For example, if you're working with a word processor, you might copy and paste text to avoid typing the same thing over and over. If there's something you want to move from one place to another, you can <strong>cut and paste </strong>instead.</p>
            <h4>To copy and paste:</h4>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>Select the item you want to copy. In our example, we'll select a word in a document.</li>
              <li>
                Right-click the mouse and select <strong>Copy </strong>from the menu that appears. You can also press <strong>Ctrl+C</strong> on your keyboard.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/common_copy_text_command.png" alt="screenshot of text editor" width={608} height={252} /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Locate and right-click the desired location for the item, then select <strong>Paste</strong>. You can also press <strong>Ctrl+V</strong> on your keyboard.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/common_copy_text_paste.png" alt="screenshot of text editor" width={608} height={255} /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                The item will be copied to the new location. Notice how the original text that was copied has not been moved or changed.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/common_copy_text_done.png" alt="screenshot of text editor" width={608} height={246} /></div>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>To cut and paste:</h4>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>Select the item you want to cut. In our example, we'll select a paragraph of text in a document.</li>
              <li>
                Right-click the mouse and select <strong>Cut </strong>from the menu that appears. You can also press <strong>Ctrl+X</strong> on your keyboard.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/common_cut_command.png" alt="screenshot of Windows 8" width={705} height={399} /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Locate and right-click the desired location for the item, then select <strong>Paste</strong>. You can also press <strong>Ctrl+V</strong> on your keyboard.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/common_cut_paste.png" alt="screenshot of Windows 8" width={637} height={368} /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                The item will be pasted, or moved, to the new location. In our example, we used the cut and paste commands to move the second paragraph above the first paragraph.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/common_cut_done.png" alt="screenshot of Windows 8" width={661} height={331} /></div>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>To copy and paste files:</h4>
            <p>You can use the cut, copy, and paste commands for a variety of tasks on your computer. For example, if you wanted to create a <strong>duplicate</strong> copy of a file, you could <strong>copy</strong> <strong>it</strong> from one folder to another.</p>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                Right-click the file and select <strong>Copy</strong> from the menu that appears. You can also press <strong>Ctrl+C</strong> on your keyboard. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/commoncomputertasks_copy.jpg" alt="copy a file" title="copy a file" /></div>
                <div />
              </li>
              <li>
                Locate and right-click the new location, then select <strong>Paste</strong>. You can also press <strong>Ctrl+V</strong> on your keyboard. In our example, we'll paste the file to the <strong>desktop</strong>. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/commoncomputertasks_paste.jpg" alt="paste the file" title="paste the file" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                The duplicate file will appear. Notice how the original file has not been moved or changed. Also, note that if you make a change to the original file, it will <strong>not</strong> update any copies of that file. 
                <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/commoncomputertasks_paste_result.jpg" alt="file appears on the desktop" title="file appears on the desktop" /></div>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="moreInfo">Copying a file is <strong>not</strong> the same as creating a shortcut. You can review our lesson on <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/working-with-files/1/" target="_self">Working with Files</a> to learn more about using shortcuts.</p>
            <h3>Undoing changes</h3>
            <p>Let's say you're working on a text document and accidentally delete some text. Fortunately, you won't have to retype everything you just deleted! Most applications allow you to <strong>undo</strong> <strong>your most recent action </strong>when you make a mistake like this. Just locate and select the <strong>Undo</strong> command, which is usually in the upper-left corner of the window near the Menu bar. You can also press <strong>Ctrl+Z</strong> on your keyboard. You can continuing using this command to undo multiple changes in a row.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/common_undo.jpg" alt="Undo button in WordPad" title="Undo button in WordPad" /></div>
            <p className="attention">Note that the Undo command will work almost all of the time, but not in every situation. For example, if you empty the Recycle Bin to permanently delete a file, you can't undo the action.</p>
            <p>Now you know some of the most commonly used commands, which you'll be able to use in almost any application on your computer. As we mentioned earlier in this lesson, you can also use <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong> to perform these commands even faster. We'll talk more about keyboard shortcuts in our lesson on <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows/1/">Keyboard Shortcuts in Windows</a>.</p>

            <h3>Adjusting your settings</h3>
            <p>At some point, you may want to adjust your computer's <strong>settings</strong>. For example, you might want to change your <strong>desktop background </strong>or modify your<strong> Internet</strong><strong> settings</strong>. You can change these settings and more from the <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
            <p>However, in Windows 10, the Control Panel has mostly been replaced by the <strong>Settings app</strong>. The Control Panel is still available, but most of the tasks and settings are now also located in the Settings app.</p>
            <h4>To open the Settings app (Windows 10):</h4>
            <p>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, then select the <strong>gear</strong> icon<strong />. <br /></p>

            <h3>Understanding user accounts</h3>
            <p>A <strong>user account </strong>allows you to <strong>sign in</strong> to your computer. By default, your computer already has one user account, which you were required to create when you set up your computer. If you plan to share your computer with others, you can create a<strong> separate user account</strong> for each person.</p>
            <h4 className="clearfl">Why use separate user accounts?</h4>
            <p>At this point, you may be wondering why you would even need to use separate user accounts. But if you're sharing a computer with multiple people—for example, with your family or at the office—user accounts allow everyone to save their own files, preferences, and settings without affecting other computer users. When you start your computer, you'll be able to choose which account you want to use.</p>
            <p><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/account_login_alt.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Windows 8" width={700} height={263} /></p>
            <h4>Administrator, Standard, and Managed accounts</h4>
            <p>Before you create new user accounts, it's important to understand the different types.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Administrator</strong>:<strong /> Administrator accounts are special accounts that are used for making changes to system settings or managing other people's accounts. They have full access to every setting on the computer. Every computer will have at least one Administrator account, and if you're the owner you should already have a password to this account.</li>
              <li><strong>Standard</strong>:<strong /> Standard accounts are the basic accounts you use for normal everyday tasks. As a Standard user, you can do just about anything you would need to do, such as running software or personalizing your desktop.</li>
              <li><strong>Standard with Family Safety</strong>:<strong /> These are the only accounts that can have <strong>parental controls</strong>. You can create a Standard account for each child, then go to the <strong>Family Safety </strong>settings in your<strong> Control Panel </strong>to set website restrictions, time limits, and more.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Generally, it's safer to be signed in to a Standard account than an Administrator account. If you're logged in as an Administrator, it may actually make it easier for an <strong>unauthorized user to make changes</strong> to your computer. Therefore, you may want to create a Standard account for yourself, even if you're not sharing the computer with anyone. You'll still be able to make <strong>Administrator-level changes</strong>; you'll just need to provide your <strong>Administrator password</strong> when making these changes.</p>
            <h3>Adding and managing user accounts</h3>
            <p>The process for adding and managing user accounts is quite different for each version of Windows. To learn more about adding and managing user accounts, review the appropriate lesson from these Windows tutorials:</p>

            <h3>Switching between user accounts</h3>
            <p>If you have multiple user accounts on your computer, it's easy to <strong>switch</strong> <strong>between</strong> users without signing out or closing your current apps. Switching users will <strong>lock</strong> the current user, so you won't need to worry about someone else accessing your account.</p>
            <h4>To switch between user accounts (Windows 10):</h4>
            <p>Click the <strong>current user icon</strong> on the left side of the <strong>Start menu</strong>, then select the <strong>desired user</strong> from the drop-down menu. The user will then need to <strong>enter a password</strong> to sign in.</p>

            <h3>Keyboard shortcuts in Windows</h3>
            <p>Keyboard shortcuts are <strong>keys or a combination of keys</strong> you can press on your keyboard to perform a variety of tasks. Using keyboard shortcuts is often <strong>faster than using a mouse</strong> because you can keep both hands on the keyboard. Keyboard shortcuts are also <strong>universal</strong>, which means you can use many of the same shortcuts in a <strong>variety of applications</strong>. For example, you can use the shortcuts to copy and paste text in a word processor and in a web browser.</p>

            <h4>Using the Alt key to navigate menus</h4>
            <p>When you press the <strong>Alt key</strong>, you will have access to all of the menus in the current application. This means you can perform almost any task with just your keyboard. For example, you can type <strong>Alt+F+X</strong> to quit an application. When performing these shortcuts, you will not need to hold down the <strong>Alt</strong> key.</p>

            <h3>Common applications in Windows</h3>
            <p>Windows comes with several useful applications already installed. These applications can help you with many common tasks, including browsing the Internet, managing your calendar, and shopping for music.</p>
            <p>Most of these apps can be opened by clicking the Start button, then clicking the icon of the app you want to open. You may need to navigate the Start menu to find the app you're looking for. Take a look at our <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/windowsbasics/navigating-windows/1/" target="_blank">Navigating Windows</a> lesson to learn more. <br /></p>

            <h4>Web browsers</h4>
            <p><a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/edge">Microsoft Edge</a> replaces Internet Explorer in Windows 10 but serves the same function. It has a few new features over Internet Explorer, including an option to display webpages in an easy-to-read format, better security,&nbsp;and integration with other parts of Windows 10. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/commonapps_windows_edge.jpg" alt="Microsoft Edge" title="Microsoft Edge" /></div>
            <p><a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internet/internetexplorer">Internet Explorer</a>  is one of the most well-known applications on the Internet, primarily  because it has come bundled with many versions of Windows for the past  20 years. It has a simple interface and most standard web browser  features, including bookmarking your favorite websites.&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Productivity</h4>
            <p>Windows 8 and Windows 10 include several productivity apps that can help you with daily tasks, like managing your email and calendars, finding directions, and organizing notes. <br /></p>
            <p><strong>Mail</strong> and <strong>Calendar</strong> are apps that connect your accounts with other services, such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple. They synchronize your mailboxes and calendars within these services and display them in a single window on your computer.</p>
            <p><strong>Maps</strong>, an app powered by Bing Maps, gives you access to all of the same navigation and search features. It adds a few other features as well, like pinning locations and saving directions on all of your Windows devices. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/commonapps_windows_maps.jpg" alt="Maps in Windows 10" title="Maps in Windows 10" /></div>
            <p><strong>OneNote</strong> is the advanced note organization software originally included with Microsoft Office, but now it's a default app in Windows 10. OneNote lets you create a collection of notes that you can then search and share.<br /></p>
            <h4>Media</h4>
            <p><strong>Photos</strong>, introduced in Windows 8, is a digital photo organizer that helps you store, sort, and display photos on your computer. It also includes features for editing, online storage, and sharing to social media. <br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/commonapps_windows_photos.jpg" alt="Photos app in Windows 10" title="Photos app in Windows 10" /></div>
            <p><strong>Groove Music</strong> and <strong>Movies &amp; TV</strong> are apps included with Windows 10 that access Microsoft's online media services. Groove Music can play music stored on your computer and OneDrive, and it can stream online music with the purchase of a monthly subscription. You can play video files stored on your computer with Movies &amp; TV, and you can use it to shop for movies and TV shows online as well.</p>
            <p><strong>Windows Media Player</strong> is Microsoft's default basic media player that has come with most versions of Windows. It can play most types of audio and video files stored on your computer. <br /></p>
            <h4>Settings</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Control Panel</strong> is where you can adjust your computer's settings and configurations. The <strong>Settings</strong> app, introduced in Windows 8, gives you access to most of your computer's settings but is designed in a new tablet style instead of the classic Windows style. <br /></p>

            <h3>Opening files with different applications</h3>
            <p>When you open a file in Windows, it will usually open <strong>in the default application for that type of file</strong>. For example, a <strong>photo</strong> will open in <strong>Windows Photo Viewer </strong>(or the <strong>Photos</strong> application in Windows 8) by default. But you may not always want this. In this lesson, we'll show you how to <strong>open a file in a different application</strong>, as well as how to <strong>change the default application</strong> so a file will always open in your preferred program.</p>
            <p className="moreInfo clearfl">If you're using Windows 8, files will usually open in a <strong>Start screen application</strong>, even if you opened it from the <strong>desktop</strong>. If you prefer to work in the desktop, you can choose to open the file with a <strong>desktop application</strong>. For example, a <strong>jpeg picture</strong> in Windows 8 will open in the <strong>Photos</strong> application by default, but you can open it on the desktop in <strong>Windows Photo Viewer</strong> instead.</p>
            <h4 className="clearfl">Opening a file in the default application</h4>
            <p>As you learned in our lesson on <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/working-with-files/1/" target="_self">Working with Files</a>, you can locate and <strong>double-click</strong> a file to open it. It will open in the <strong>default application</strong> for that type of file.<br /></p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/diff_open_default.jpg" alt="Pictures folder" title="Pictures folder" /></div>
            <h4>To open a file in a different application:</h4>
            <p>Sometimes you may want to open a file in a different application <strong>without changing the default</strong>. For example, you may want to open a photo with <strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Paint</strong> to crop or resize it.</p>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                From the desktop, <strong>right-click</strong> the desired file.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/diff_open_default.jpg" alt="right-click a file" title="right-click a file" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                From the drop-down menu, click <strong>Open with</strong>, then select the desired <strong>application</strong>. In this example, we'll select <strong>Paint</strong>.

              <li>
                The file will open in the selected application.

              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>To change the default application:</h4>
            <p>You may prefer to change the <strong>default application</strong> for certain types of files so they'll <strong>always open in the new app</strong> when you double-click them. For example, you may want your photos to always open in <strong>Windows Photo Viewer</strong> instead of the <strong>Photos</strong> application.</p>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                From the desktop, <strong>right-click</strong> the desired file, select <strong>Open with</strong>, and click <strong>Choose another app </strong>from the menu that appears.

              </li>
              <li>
                Select the desired <strong>application</strong>. If you don't see the one you want, click <strong>More apps </strong>or<strong> Look for an app in the Store</strong>to look for other applications. In this example, we want to open the file in <strong>Windows Photo Viewer</strong>. Then check off <strong>Always use this app to open .jpg files</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.

              </li>
              <li>
                The file will open in the new application. The next time you double-click a file of that type, it will open in the new default application.

            <h3>What is a flash drive?</h3>
            <p>A flash drive is a <strong>small, removable hard drive</strong> that plugs into a <strong>USB</strong> <strong>port</strong> on your computer. You can purchase a flash drive for less than $20 at just about any retail store with an electronics department, and even at some grocery stores and pharmacies. Flash drives are a convenient way to <strong>bring your files with you</strong> and open them on a different computer. You could also use a flash drive to <strong>back up</strong> important documents and other files. In this lesson, we'll show you how to use a flash drive with your computer.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Do you know what to do if your screen goes blank? What if you can't seem to close an application, or can't hear any sound from your speakers? Whenever you have a problem with your computer, <strong>don't panic</strong>! There are some <strong>basic troubleshooting techniques</strong> you can use to fix issues like this. In this lesson, we'll show you some simple things to try when troubleshooting, as well as how to solve common problems you may encounter.</p>
            <h4>Basic troubleshooting techniques</h4>
            <p>There are many different things that could cause a problem with your computer. No matter what's causing the issue, troubleshooting will always be a process of <strong>trial and error</strong>. In some cases, you may need to use several approaches before you can find a solution; other problems may be easy to fix. We recommend starting by using the <strong>following tips</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Write down your steps</strong>. Once you start troubleshooting, you may want to <strong>write down </strong>each step you take. This way, you'll be able to remember exactly what you've done so you can avoid repeating the same mistakes. If you end up asking other people for help, it will be much easier if they know exactly what you've already tried.</li>
              <li><strong>Take notes about error messages</strong>. If your computer gives you an <strong>error message</strong>, be sure to write down as much information as possible. You may be able to use this information later to find out if other people are seeing the same error.</li>
              <li><strong>Always check the cables</strong>. If you're having trouble with a specific piece of computer <strong>hardware</strong>, such as your monitor or keyboard, an easy first step is to check all related cables to make sure they're properly connected.</li>
              <li><strong>Restart the computer</strong>. When all else fails, one of the best things to try is simply <strong>restarting the computer</strong>. This can solve a lot of basic issues you may experience with your computer.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Troubleshooting specific problems</h3>
            <p>Now that you know a few troubleshooting techniques, we'll talk about possible solutions for some of the most common problems you may encounter.</p>
            <h4>Problem: An application is running slowly</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Solution 1</strong>: Close and reopen the application.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Solution 2</strong>: Update the application. To do this, click the <strong>Help</strong> menu and look for an option to <strong>Check for Updates</strong>. If you don't find this option, another idea is to run an online search for application updates.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/trouble_update.jpg" alt="selecting Check for Updates from the Help menu" title="selecting Check for Updates from the Help menu" /></div>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Problem: An application is frozen</h4>
            <p>Sometimes an application may become stuck, or <strong>frozen</strong>. When this happens, you won't be able to close the window or click any buttons within the application.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Solution 1</strong>: Force quit the application. If a program has become completely unresponsive, you can press (and hold) <strong>Ctrl+Alt+Delete</strong> (the Control, Alt, and Delete keys) on your keyboard to open the <strong>Task Manager</strong>. You can then select the unresponsive application and click <strong>End task</strong> to close it.
                <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/trouble_task.jpg" alt="Task Manager" title="Task Manager" /></div>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Restart the computer. If you are unable to force quit an application, <strong>restarting</strong> your computer will close all open apps.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Problem: The computer is frozen</h4>
            <p>Sometimes your computer may become completely unresponsive, or frozen. When this happens, you won't be able to click anywhere on the screen, open or close applications, or access shut-down options.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Solution 1</strong>: Restart Windows Explorer. To do this, press and hold <strong>Ctrl+Alt+Delete </strong>on your keyboard to open the <strong>Task Manager</strong>. Next, locate and select <strong>Windows Explorer </strong> from the <strong>Processes</strong> tab and click <strong>Restart</strong>.

            <h3>How to survive the end of Windows XP support</h3>
            <p>As you may already know, Microsoft <strong>ended support for the Windows XP operating system</strong> on April 8, 2014. If you're one of the millions of people who uses Windows XP, you may be wondering what this means for you. We'd like to try to answer some questions you may have at this time.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Windows Basics_ Windows Basics Quiz_files/windows-xp-warning.png" alt="screenshot of windows xp" width={405} height={173} /></div>
            <h4>What exactly does ending support mean?</h4>
            <p>Microsoft has <strong>stopped providing any type of technical support</strong> for Windows XP computers. If you have Windows XP, this means your computer will no longer receive automatic updates from Microsoft, including potentially important security fixes. This also means Microsoft<strong> will no longer support Internet Explorer 8</strong>, the default web browser for Windows XP. Continuing to use XP and IE8 could expose your computer to serious threats, including viruses and malware.</p>
            <h4>Which operating systems are still supported?</h4>
            <p>Microsoft will continue to offer support for Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.</p>
            <h4>How do I know if my computer has XP?</h4>
            <p>Windows XP was released in 2001 and was pre-installed on most new PCs from 2001 through 2007. If you're not sure if you have XP, you can go to <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-operating-system" target="_blank">this page</a> </strong>from Microsoft to see which version of Windows is installed on your computer.</p>
            <h4>Will my XP computer still work?</h4>
            <p>Yes, your computer should continue to work normally after the end of XP support. However, because XP won't receive regular security updates from Microsoft, your computer will be at a <strong>much higher risk for viruses and malware</strong>. If at all possible, we recommend upgrading to a newer computer.</p>
            <h4>I don't want to upgrade. How can I keep my Windows XP machine safe?</h4>
            <p>If you continue to use XP after the end of support, we recommend that you <strong>stop using Internet Explorer 8</strong> and upgrade to a <strong>modern web browser</strong>, like<strong> <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a></strong>. While this should help to make your computer somewhat less vulnerable to external threats, keep in mind that this is not a permanent solution. Your computer will still be at a high risk for viruses and malware.</p>
            <h4>I'd like to upgrade, but I don't want Windows 8 or Windows 10. Can I still get Windows 7?</h4>
            <p className="p1">If you feel comfortable installing your own software, you can still buy a Windows 7 installation disc from third-party retailers like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=windows%207&sprefix=window%2Caps&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Awindows%207" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a>. Keep in mind that your machine will need to meet the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/system-requirements" target="_blank"><strong>Windows 7</strong> <strong>system</strong> <strong>requirements</strong></a>. If your computer was originally designed to run XP, it probably won't be able to run Windows 7 very well. <br /></p>
            <p className="p2">If you're willing to purchase a new computer, certain manufacturers—including <strong><a href="http://shopping.hp.com/" target="_blank">HP</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.dell.com/" target="_blank">Dell</a></strong>—are still producing computers that come with Windows 7 pre-installed. However, at this point, we'd recommend purchasing a new machine that uses Windows 10. It's faster, more secure, and will be supported by Microsoft for much longer.</p>
            <h4 className="p2">Wait, I have more questions!</h4>
            <p className="p2">We hope this answers some of the basic questions you may have about the end of Windows XP support. You can always contact Microsoft directly with questions in the <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp?WT.mc_id=SMCPSC_ENGB_TXT_ANS&auth=1" target="_blank">Microsoft Community Forum</a></strong>.</p>

            <h3>Why you should upgrade to Windows 10</h3>
            <p className="moreInfo"><strong>Note</strong>: The Windows 10 free upgrade offer expired on July 29, 2016. If you still want to upgrade to Windows 10, you'll need to purchase it from Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100">here</a>.<br /></p>
            <p>Windows 10 is the most recent version of the Windows operating system for PCs. Although it has mostly been well-received, Microsoft did attract some <a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/microsofts-windows-10-push-is-effective-damaging-desirable-and-deceptive/">controversy</a> in 2016 due to its push to upgrade users from earlier versions of Windows. Many users complained that it was difficult to <strong>opt out</strong> of the upgrade, and in some cases their computers were upgraded without their knowledge. Despite this controversy, we do still recommend that you upgrade your computer to Windows 10. <br /></p>

            <h4>Why should I upgrade?</h4>
            <p>If you're happy with your current version of Windows, you might be wondering <strong>why you should upgrade</strong>. After all, Windows updates have historically created a number of problems for PC users, especially with the release of Windows 8. While Windows 10 is not without some issues, it's probably the most <strong>stable</strong> and <strong>secure</strong> version of Windows that's ever been released. It also includes several <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windows10/windows-10-features/1/">new features</a>, including Microsoft Edge and Cortana, that can make your computer feel a lot more powerful. <br /></p>

            <p>Perhaps most importantly, Windows 10 will also continue to be supported by Microsoft  for <a target="_blank" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle">much longer</a> than Windows 7 or Windows 8.  That's why we <strong>strongly recommend </strong>taking advantage of the free upgrade offer before it expires. As with any major operating system update, we also recommend <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/techsavvy/backing-up-your-files/1/">backing up your files</a> before upgrading.</p>
