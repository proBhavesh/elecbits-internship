                </div>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is an increasingly important part of everyday life for people around the world. But if you've never used the Internet before, all of this new information might feel a bit confusing at first.</p>
                <p>Throughout this tutorial, we'll try to answer some basic questions you may have about the Internet and how it's used. When you're done, you'll have a good understanding of <strong>how the Internet works</strong>, how to <strong>connect to the Internet</strong>, and <strong>how to browse the Web</strong>.</p>
                <h4>What is the Internet?</h4>
                <p>The Internet is a <strong>global network </strong>of billions of computers and other electronic devices. With the Internet, it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and do much more.</p>
                <p>You can do all of this by connecting a computer to the Internet, which is also called <strong>going</strong> <strong>online</strong><strong>. </strong>When someone says a computer is<strong> </strong>online, it's just another way of saying it's connected to the Internet.</p>
                <div><img alt="Computers wirelessly connecting to the Internet" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/connectingtotheinternet_image.png" /></div>
                <h4>What is the Web?</h4>
                <p>The <strong>World Wide Web</strong>—usually called the <strong>Web</strong> for short—is a collection of different <strong>websites</strong> you can access through the Internet. A <strong>website </strong>is made up of related text, images, and other resources. Websites can resemble other forms of media—like newspaper articles or television programs—or they can be interactive in a way that's unique to computers.</p>
                <p>The purpose of a website can be almost anything: a news platform, an advertisement, an online library, a forum for sharing images, or an educational site like us!</p>
                <div className="centerImage"><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/browsingtheweb_image.png" alt="A learner browsing GCFLearnFree.org" /></div>
                <p>Once you are connected to the Internet, you can access and view websites using a type of application called a <strong>web browser</strong>. Just keep in mind that the web browser itself is not the Internet; it only displays websites that are stored on the Internet.</p>
                <h4>How does the Internet work?</h4>
                <p>At this point you may be wondering, <strong>how does the Internet work? </strong>The exact answer is pretty complicated and would take a while to explain. Instead, let's look at some of the most important things you should know.</p>
                <p>It's important to realize that the Internet is a global network of <strong>physical cables</strong>, which can include copper telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. Even wireless connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet. </p>
                <p>When you visit a website, your computer sends a request over these wires to a <strong>server</strong>. A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive. Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your computer. What's amazing is that this all happens in just a few seconds! <br /></p>

                <h4>Other things you can do on the Internet</h4>
                <p>One of the best features of the Internet is the ability to communicate almost instantly with anyone in the world. <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/email101">Email</a> is one of the oldest and most universal ways to communicate and share information on the Internet, and billions of people use it. <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/topics/socialmedia">Social media</a> allows people to connect in a variety of ways and build communities online.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>There's almost no limit to what you can do online. The Internet makes it possible to <strong />quickly<strong /> find information, communicate with people around the world, manage your finances, shop from home, listen to music, watch videos, and much, much more. Let's take a look at some of the ways the Internet is most commonly used today.</p>
            <h4>Finding information online</h4>
            <p>With billions of websites online today, there  is <strong>a lot </strong>of information on the Internet. <strong>Search engines </strong>make this information easier to find. All you have to do is type one or more<strong> keywords</strong>, and the search engine will look for <strong>relevant</strong><strong> websites</strong>.</p>
            <p>For example, let's say you're looking for a new pair of shoes. You could use a search engine to learn about different types of shoes, get directions to a nearby shoe store, or even find out where to buy them online!</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching the web" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search.jpg" /></div>
            <p>There are many different search engines you can use, but some of the most popular include  <a target="_blank" title="Google" href="http://www.google.com/"><strong>Google</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>.</p>
            <h4>Email</h4>
            <p>Short for electronic mail, <strong>email</strong>  is a way to <strong>send and receive messages</strong> across the Internet. Almost everyone who uses the Internet has their own email account, usually called an <strong>email address</strong>. This is because you'll need an email address to do just about anything online, from online banking to creating a Facebook account.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/send_2_compose_send.png" /></div>
            <h4>Social networking</h4>
            <p><strong> Social networking websites</strong> are another way to<strong> connect and share</strong> with your family and friends online. Rather than sharing with just a few people over email, social networks make it easier to <strong>connect</strong> and <strong>share</strong> with many people at the same time. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> is the world's largest social networking site, with <strong>more than</strong> <strong>1 billion users </strong>worldwide.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 681, height: 294}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2014_share_friend_timeline.jpg" width={681} height={294} /></div>
            <h4>Chat and instant messaging</h4>
            <p><strong>Chat</strong> and <strong>instant messaging (IM) </strong>are short messages sent and read <strong>in real time</strong>, allowing you to converse more quickly and easily than email. These are generally used when both (or all) people are online, so your message can be read immediately. By comparison, <strong>emails</strong> won't be seen until recipients check their inboxes.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/using_chat.png" alt="Screenshot of chat" width={229} height={315} /></div>
            <p>Examples of instant messaging applications include <strong>Yahoo Messenger</strong> and <strong>Google Hangouts</strong>. Some sites, like <strong>Gmail</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong>, even allow you to chat within your web browser.</p>
            <h4>Online media</h4>
            <p>There are many sites that allow you to <strong>watch videos </strong>and <strong>listen to music</strong>.<strong /> For example, you can watch millions of videos on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> or listen to Internet radio on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a>. Other services, like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a>, allow you to watch movies and TV shows. And if have a <strong>set-top streaming box</strong>, you can even watch them directly on your television instead of a computer screen.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img alt="streaming TV " src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/livestreamvideo_introimage.png" /></div>
            <h4>Everyday tasks</h4>
            <p>You can also use the Internet to complete many <strong>everyday tasks</strong> and <strong>errands</strong><strong />.<strong /> For example, you can manage your bank account, pay your bills, and shop for just about anything. The main advantage here is <strong>convenience</strong>. Rather than going from place to place, you can do all of these tasks at home!</p>

            <h4>And a whole lot more!</h4>
            <p>Remember, these are just a few of the things you'll be able to do online. Keep working through this tutorial to learn more about connecting to the Internet and using the Web!<br /></p>

            <h3>How do I connect to the Internet?</h3>
            <p>Once you've set up your computer, you may want to purchase <strong>home</strong> <strong>Internet access</strong> so you can send and receive email, browse the Web, stream videos, and more. You may even want to set up a <strong>home wireless network</strong>, commonly known as <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, so you can connect multiple devices to the Internet at the same time.</p>
            <p className="chevron">Watch the video below to learn about connecting to the Internet.<br /></p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/93-3zmVvCGU.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /></div>
            <p className="moreInfo">Looking for the old version of this video? You can still view it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMX6dVa61t0" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /></p>
            <h3 className="clearfl">Types of Internet service</h3>
            <p>The type of Internet service you choose will largely depend<strong /><strong> </strong>on which <strong>Internet service providers </strong>(ISPs) serve your area, along with the types of service they offer. Here are some common types of Internet service.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Dial-up</strong>:<strong> </strong>This is generally the slowest type of Internet connection, and you should probably avoid it unless it is the only service available in your area. Dial-up Internet uses your <strong>phone line</strong>, so unless you have multiple phone lines you will not be able to use your landline and the Internet at the same time.</li>
              <li><strong>DSL</strong>: DSL service uses a <strong>broadband connection</strong>, which makes it much faster than dial-up. DSL connects to the Internet <strong>via a phone line</strong> but does not require you to have a landline at home. And unlike dial-up,  you'll be able to use the Internet and your phone line at the same time.</li>
              <li><strong>Cable</strong>:<strong /> Cable service connects to the Internet <strong>via cable TV</strong>, although you do not necessarily need to have cable TV in order to get it. It uses a broadband connection and can be faster than both dial-up and DSL service; however, it is only available where cable TV is available.</li>
              <li><strong>Satellite</strong>: A satellite connection uses broadband but does not require cable or phone lines; it connects to the Internet <strong>through satellites orbiting the Earth</strong>. As a result, it can be used almost anywhere in the world, but the connection may be affected by weather patterns. Satellite connections are also usually slower than DSL or cable.</li>
              <li><strong>3G and 4G</strong>: 3G and 4G service is most commonly used with mobile phones, and it connects <strong>wirelessly</strong> through your ISP's network. However, these types of connections aren't always as fast as DSL or cable. They will also <strong>limit the amount of data</strong> you can use each month, which isn't the case with most broadband plans.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Choosing an Internet service provider</h3>
            <p>Now that you know about the different types of Internet service, you can do some research to find out what ISPs are available in your area. If you're having trouble getting started, we recommend talking to friends, family members, and neighbors about the ISPs they use. This will usually give you a good idea of the types of Internet service available in your area. <br /></p>
            <p>Most ISPs offer several tiers of service with different Internet speeds, usually measured in <strong>Mbps </strong>(short for <strong>megabits</strong> <strong>per</strong> <strong>second</strong>). If you mainly want to use the Internet for <strong>email</strong> and <strong>social networking</strong>, a slower connection (around 2 to 5 Mbps) might be all you need. However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> <strong>music</strong> or <strong>stream videos</strong>, you'll want a faster connection (at least 5 Mbps or higher).</p>
            <p>You'll also want to <strong>consider the cost </strong>of the service, including installation charges and monthly fees. Generally speaking, the faster the connection, the more expensive it will be per month. <br /></p>
            <p className="moreInfo">Although <strong>dial-up</strong> has traditionally been the <strong>least expensive</strong> option, many ISPs have raised dial-up prices to be the <strong>same as broadband</strong>. This is intended to encourage people to switch to broadband. We do not recommend dial-up Internet unless it's your only option.<br /></p>
            <h3>Hardware needed</h3>
            <h4>Modem</h4>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/Connect_modem-02.jpg" alt="modem" title="modem" /></div>
            <p>Once you have your computer, you really don't need much additional hardware to connect to the Internet. The primary piece of hardware you need is a <strong>modem</strong>.</p>
            <p>The type of Internet access you choose will determine the type of modem you need. <strong>Dial-up</strong> access uses a <strong>telephone modem</strong>,<strong /> <strong>DSL</strong> service uses a <strong>DSL modem</strong>, <strong>cable</strong> access uses a <strong>cable modem</strong>, and <strong>satellite</strong> service uses a <strong>satellite adapter</strong>. Your ISP may give you a modem—often for a fee—when you sign a contract, which helps ensure that you have the <strong>right type</strong> of modem. However, if you would prefer to shop for a <strong>better</strong> or <strong>less expensive</strong> modem, you can choose to buy one separately.</p>
            <h4>Router</h4>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/Connect_router-02.jpg" alt="wireless router" title="wireless router" /></div>
            <p>A <strong>router</strong> is a hardware device that allows you to connect <strong>several computers</strong> and <strong>other devices</strong> to a single Internet connection, which is known as a <strong>home network</strong>. Many routers are <strong>wireless</strong>, which allows you to create a <strong>home wireless network</strong>,<strong> </strong>commonly known as a <strong>Wi-Fi network</strong>.</p>
            <p>You <strong>don't necessarily need to buy a router</strong> to connect to the Internet. It's possible to connect your computer directly to your modem using an Ethernet cable. Also, many modems include a <strong>built-in router</strong>, so you have the option of creating a Wi-Fi network without buying extra hardware.</p>
            <h3>Setting up your Internet connection</h3>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/Connect_ISP-house-02.jpg" alt="technician at a house" title="technician at a house" /></div>
            <p>Once you've chosen an ISP, most providers will <strong>send a technician to your house</strong> to turn on the connection. If not, you should be able to use the instructions provided by your ISP—or included with the modem—to set up your Internet connection.</p>
            <p>After you have everything set up, you can open your <strong>web browser</strong> and begin using the Internet. If you have any problems with your Internet connection, you can call your ISP's <strong>technical support</strong> number. <br /></p>
            <h3>Home networking</h3>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/Connect_home-wifi.jpg" alt="home network" title="home network" /></div>
            <p>If you have multiple computers at home and want to use all of them to access the Internet, you may want to create a <strong>home network</strong>, also known as<strong> </strong>a<strong> Wi-Fi network</strong>. In a home network, all of your devices connect to your <strong>router</strong>, which is connected to the <strong>modem</strong>. This means everyone in your family can use the Internet <strong>at the same time</strong>.</p>
            <p>Your ISP technician may be able to set up a home Wi-Fi network when installing your Internet service. If not, you can review our lesson on <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/basic-computer-skills/how-to-set-up-a-wifi-network/1/">How to Set Up a  Wi-Fi Network</a> to learn more. <br /><strong /></p>
            <p className="moreInfo">If you want to connect a computer that does not have built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, you can purchase a <strong>Wi-Fi adapter</strong> that plugs into your computer's USB port.<br /></p>

If you're having trouble getting started, we recommend talking to friends, family members, and neighbors about the ISPs they use. This will usually give you a good idea of the types of Internet service available in your area. <br /></p>
            <p>Most ISPs offer several tiers of service with different Internet speeds, usually measured in <strong>Mbps </strong>(short for <strong>megabits</strong> <strong>per</strong> <strong>second</strong>). If you mainly want to use the Internet for <strong>email</strong> and <strong>social networking</strong>, a slower connection (around 2 to 5 Mbps) might be all you need. However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> <strong>music</strong> or <strong>stream videos</strong>, you'll want a faster connection (at least 5 Mbps or higher).</p>
            <p>You'll also want to <strong>consider the cost </strong>of the service, including installation charges and monthly fees. Generally speaking, the faster the connection, the more expensive it will be per month. <br /></p>
            <p className="moreInfo">Although <strong>dial-up</strong> has traditionally been the <strong>least expensive</strong> option, many ISPs have raised dial-up prices to be the <strong>same as broadband</strong>. This is intended to encourage people to switch to broadband. We do not recommend dial-up Internet unless it's your only option.<br /></p>
            <h3>Hardware needed</h3>
            <h4>Modem</h4>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/Connect_modem-02.jpg" alt="modem" title="modem" /></div>
            <p>Once you have your computer, you really don't need much additional hardware to connect to the Internet. The primary piece of hardware you need is a <strong>modem</strong>.</p>
            <p>The type of Internet access you choose will determine the type of modem you need. <strong>Dial-up</strong> access uses a <strong>telephone modem</strong>,<strong /> <strong>DSL</strong> service uses a <strong>DSL modem</strong>, <strong>cable</strong> access uses a <strong>cable modem</strong>, and <strong>satellite</strong> service uses a <strong>satellite adapter</strong>. Your ISP may give you a modem—often for a fee—when you sign a contract, which helps ensure that you have the <strong>right type</strong> of modem. However, if you would prefer to shop for a <strong>better</strong> or <strong>less expensive</strong> modem, you can choose to buy one separately.</p>
            <h4>Router</h4>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/Connect_router-02.jpg" alt="wireless router" title="wireless router" /></div>
            <p>A <strong>router</strong> is a hardware device that allows you to connect <strong>several computers</strong> and <strong>other devices</strong> to a single Internet connection, which is known as a <strong>home network</strong>. Many routers are <strong>wireless</strong>, which allows you to create a <strong>home wireless network</strong>,<strong> </strong>commonly known as a <strong>Wi-Fi network</strong>.</p>
            <p>You <strong>don't necessarily need to buy a router</strong> to connect to the Internet. It's possible to connect your computer directly to your modem using an Ethernet cable. Also, many modems include a <strong>built-in router</strong>, so you have the option of creating a Wi-Fi network without buying extra hardware.</p>
            <h3>Setting up your Internet connection</h3>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/Connect_ISP-house-02.jpg" alt="technician at a house" title="technician at a house" /></div>
            <p>Once you've chosen an ISP, most providers will <strong>send a technician to your house</strong> to turn on the connection. If not, you should be able to use the instructions provided by your ISP—or included with the modem—to set up your Internet connection.</p>
            <p>After you have everything set up, you can open your <strong>web browser</strong> and begin using the Internet. If you have any problems with your Internet connection, you can call your ISP's <strong>technical support</strong> number. <br /></p>
            <h3>Home networking</h3>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/Connect_home-wifi.jpg" alt="home network" title="home network" /></div>
            <p>If you have multiple computers at home and want to use all of them to access the Internet, you may want to create a <strong>home network</strong>, also known as<strong> </strong>a<strong> Wi-Fi network</strong>. In a home network, all of your devices connect to your <strong>router</strong>, which is connected to the <strong>modem</strong>. This means everyone in your family can use the Internet <strong>at the same time</strong>.</p>
            <p>Your ISP technician may be able to set up a home Wi-Fi network when installing your Internet service. If not, you can review our lesson on <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/basic-computer-skills/how-to-set-up-a-wifi-network/1/">How to Set Up a  Wi-Fi Network</a> to learn more. <br /><strong /></p>
            <p className="moreInfo">If you want to connect a computer that does not have built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, you can purchase a <strong>Wi-Fi adapter</strong> that plugs into your computer's USB port.<br /></p>

            <h3>What is the cloud?</h3>
            <p>You may have heard people using terms like <strong>the cloud</strong>, <strong>cloud computing</strong>, or <strong>cloud storage</strong>. But what exactly is the cloud?</p>
            <p>Simply put, the cloud is <strong>the Internet</strong>—more specifically, it's all of the things you can <strong>access remotely</strong> over the Internet. When something is <strong>in the cloud</strong>, it means it's stored on <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>servers</strong> instead of your computer's hard drive.</p>
            <p className="chevron">Watch the video below to learn more about the cloud.<br /></p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/4OO77HFcCUs.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /></div>
            <p className="moreInfo">Looking for the old version of this video? You can still view it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu4FYSFeWqg" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /></p>
            <h3>Why use the cloud?</h3>
            <p>Some of the main reasons to use the cloud are <strong>convenience</strong> and <strong>reliability</strong>. For example, if you've ever used a <strong>web-based email service</strong>, such as <strong>Gmail</strong> or<strong> Yahoo! Mail</strong>, you've already used the cloud. All of the emails in a web-based service are stored on servers rather than on your computer's hard drive. This means you can access your email from any computer with an Internet connection. It also means you'll be able to recover your emails if something happens to your computer.</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/computerbasics_cloud_gmail.jpg" alt="Gmail" title="Gmail" /></div>
            <p>Let's look at some of the most common reasons to use the cloud.  <br /></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>File storage</strong>: You can store all types of information in the cloud, including files and email. This means you can access these things from <strong>any computer </strong>or<strong> mobile device </strong>with an Internet connection, not just your home computer. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/drive">Google Drive</a> are some of the most popular cloud-based storage services. 
                <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/backingupfiles_googledrive.jpg" alt="Google Drive" title="Google Drive" /></div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>File sharing</strong>: The cloud makes it easy to <strong>share</strong> <strong>files</strong> with several people at the same time. For example, you could upload several photos to a cloud-based photo service like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/photos/">iCloud Photos</a>, then quickly share them with friends and family. 
                <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/photos_online_backup.jpg" alt="storing photos in the cloud" title="storing photos in the cloud" /></div>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Backing up data</strong>: You can also use the cloud to protect your files. There are apps such as <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/" target="_blank">Carbonite</a> that <strong>automatically back up your data</strong> to the cloud. This way, if  your computer ever is lost, stolen, or damaged, you'll still be able to recover these files from the cloud.</li>

            <h3>What is a web app?</h3>
            <p>Previously, we talked about how <strong>desktop applications</strong> allow you to perform tasks on your computer. But there are also <strong>web applications</strong>—or <strong>web apps</strong>—that run <strong>in the cloud</strong> and do not need to be installed on your computer. Many of the most popular sites on the Internet are actually web apps. You may have even used a web app without realizing it! Let's take a look at some popular web apps.<br /></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>:</strong> Facebook lets you create an online <strong>profile</strong> and interact with your <strong>friends</strong>. Profiles and conversations can be updated at any time, so Facebook uses web app technologies to <strong>keep the information up to date</strong>.

            <h3>Using a web browser</h3>
            <p>A <strong>web browser</strong> is a type of software that allows you to find and view websites on the Internet. Even if you didn't know it, you're using a web browser right now to read this page! There are many different web browsers, but some of the most common ones include <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>, <strong>Safari</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>, and <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong>.</p>
            <p>No matter which web browser you use, you'll want to learn the basics of browsing the Web. In this lesson, we'll talk about <strong>navigating</strong> to different websites, <strong>using tabbed</strong> <strong>browsing</strong>, creating <strong>bookmarks</strong>, and more.</p>
            <p className="chevron">Watch the video below to learn the basics of using a web browser.</p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/FxirRVJWUTs.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /></div>
            <p className="moreInfo">We'll be using the <strong>Google Chrome web browser</strong> throughout this lesson, but you can use any browser you want. Keep in mind that your browser may look and act a bit differently, but all web browsers work in basically the same way. <br /></p>
            <h4>URLs and the address bar</h4>
            <p>Each website has a unique address, called a <strong>URL</strong> (short for <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>). It's like a street address that tells  your browser where to go on the Internet. When you type a URL into the browser's <strong>address bar</strong> and press <strong>Enter </strong>on your keyboard, the browser will load the page associated with that URL.</p>
            <p>In the example below, we've typed <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.com/travel">www.bbc.com/travel</a> </strong>into the address bar.</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/browser_url.jpg" alt="The address bar" title="The address bar" /></div>
            <h4>Links</h4>
            <p>Whenever you see a word or phrase on a website that's<strong> blue </strong>or<strong> underlined in blue</strong>, it's probably a <strong>hyperlink</strong>, or <strong>link</strong> for short. You might already know how links work, even if you've never thought about them much before. For example, try clicking the link below.</p>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/"><u>Hey, I'm a link! Click me!</u></a></p>
            <p>Links are used to <strong>navigate the Web</strong>. When you click a link, it will usually take you to a different webpage. You may also notice that your cursor changes into a<strong> hand icon</strong> whenever you hover over a link.</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/browser_hand_icon.jpg" alt="Clicking a link" title="Clicking a link" /></div>
            <p>If you see this icon, it means you've found a link. You'll find other types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use <strong>images</strong> as links, so you can just <strong>click the image</strong> to navigate to another page.</p>
            <p className="moreInfo">Review our lesson on <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internetbasics/understanding-hyperlinks/1/" target="_blank">Understanding Hyperlinks</a> to learn more.<br /></p>
            <h4>Navigation buttons</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Back</strong>  and <strong>Forward</strong>  buttons allow you to move through websites you've <strong>recently viewed</strong>. You can also click and hold either button to see your recent history.</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/browser_back_forward.jpg" alt="Back and forward buttons" title="Back and forward buttons" /></div>
            <p>The <strong>Refresh</strong> button will <strong>reload </strong>the current page. If a website stops working, try using the Refresh button.</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/browser_reload.jpg" alt="The refresh button" title="The refresh button" /></div>
            <h4>Tabbed browsing</h4>
            <p>Many browsers allow you to open links in a new <strong>tab</strong>. You can open as many links as you want, and they'll stay in the <strong>same browser window</strong> instead of cluttering your screen with multiple windows.</p>
            <p>To open a link in a new tab, <strong>right-click</strong> the link and select <strong>Open link in new tab</strong> (the exact wording may vary from browser to browser).</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/browser_link_tab.jpg" alt="Opening a link in a new tab" title="Opening a link in a new tab" /></div>
            <p>To <strong>close</strong> a tab, click the <strong>X</strong>.</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/browser_close_tab.jpg" alt="Closing a tab" title="Closing a tab" /></div>
            <p>To create a <strong>new blank tab</strong>, click the button to the right of any open tabs.</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/browser_new_tab.jpg" alt="Opening a new tab" title="Opening a new tab" /></div>
            <h4>Bookmarks and history</h4>
            <p>If you find a website you want to view later, it can be hard to memorize the exact web address. <strong>Bookmarks</strong>, also known as <strong>favorites</strong>, are a great way to save and organize specific websites so you can revisit them again and again. Simply locate and select the <strong>Star</strong> icon to bookmark the current website.</p>

            <p>Your browser will also keep a history of every site you visit. This is another good way to find a site you visited previously. To view your history, open your browser settings—usually by clicking the icon in the upper-right corner—and select <strong>History</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Downloading files</h4>
            <p>Links don't always go to another website. In some cases, they point to a <strong>file</strong> that can be <strong>downloaded</strong>, or saved, to your computer.</p>
            <p>If you click a link to a file, it may download automatically, but sometimes it just <strong>opens within your browser</strong> instead of downloading.<span className="redactor-invisible-space" /> To prevent it from opening in the browser, you can <strong>right-click</strong> the link and select <strong>Save link as</strong> (different browsers may use slightly different wording, like <strong>Save target as</strong>).</p>

            <h4>Saving images</h4>
            <p>Sometimes you may want to save an image from a website to your computer. To do this, right-click the image and select <strong>Save image as</strong> (or <strong>Save picture as</strong>).</p>

            <h4>Plug-ins</h4>
            <p><strong>Plug-ins</strong> are small applications that allow you to view certain types of content within your web browser. For example, <strong>Adobe Flash</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Silverlight</strong> are sometimes used to play videos, while <strong>Adobe Reader</strong> is used to view PDF files.</p>
            <p> If you don't have the correct plug-in for a website, your browser will usually provide a link to download it. There may also be times when you need to <strong>update</strong> your plug-ins. Review our lesson on <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internet-tips/installing-and-updating-browser-plugins/1/">Installing and Updating Plug-ins</a> to learn more.</p>

            <h3>Understanding hyperlinks</h3>
            <p>Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit different? Whenever you see a word or phrase that's <strong>underlined in blue</strong>, it's probably a <strong>hyperlink</strong>, or <strong>link</strong> for short. You might already know how links work, even if you've never thought about them much before. For example, try clicking the link below.</p>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/"><u>Hey, I'm a link! Click me!</u></a></p>
            <p>Links are used to <strong>navigate the Web</strong>. When you click a link, it will take you to a different webpage. In the example below, we're clicking a link to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.<br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/understanding_hyperlinks_wikipedia_link.jpg" alt="using links to navigate Wikipedia.org" title="using links to navigate Wikipedia.org" /></div>
            <p>When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most web browsers show the link's URL in the bottom-left corner&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;window.<br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/understanding_hyperlinks_link_preview.png" alt="viewing the link preview" title="viewing the link preview" /></div>
            <p>You may also notice that your cursor changes into a<strong> hand icon</strong> whenever you hover over a link.</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/understanding_hyperlinks_library.jpg" style={{width: 556, height: '200.267px'}} alt="viewing the cursor as a hand icon" title="viewing the cursor as a hand icon" width={556} height="200.267" /></div>
            <p>If you see this icon, it means you've found a link. You'll find other types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use <strong>images</strong> as links, so you can just <strong>click the image</strong> to navigate to another page. In the example below, we're clicking the picture of a coffee mug to open a page with more information about it.<br /></p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/understanding_hyperlinks_etsy.jpg" style={{width: 580, height: '399.817px'}} alt="clicking an image formatted as a link" title="clicking an image formatted as a link" width={580} height="399.817" /></div>
            <p>Links don't always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you to <strong>download a file</strong>. When you click a link like this, the file will be downloaded to your computer. In the example below, we're downloading an installation file for a new application.</p>
            <div><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/understanding_hyperlinks_download.png" style={{width: 569, height: '370.167px'}} alt="downloading a file from a link" title="downloading a file from a link" width={569} height="370.167" /></div>
            <p>As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and do a whole lot more.</p>

            <h3> Downloading and uploading</h3>
            <div className="centerImage"><img alt="Abstract diagram of downloading and uploading" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/intro_imagev2.png" /></div>
            <p>While exploring the Internet, you’ve probably encountered the terms <strong>downloading</strong> and <strong>uploading</strong>. <strong>Downloading</strong> means receiving data or a file from the Internet on your computer. <strong>Uploading</strong> means sending data or a file from your computer to somewhere on the Internet.</p>
            <p>These terms describe activities you may have already learned how to do. If you've ever opened an example document in one of our tutorials, you've downloaded that file. If you’ve ever shared a photo you took on Facebook or another social media site, you've uploaded that photo.</p>
            <h4>Downloading</h4>
            <p>Usually, when you download a file you will start the download by clicking a link to that file. Many of our tutorials contain links to files, like this:</p>
            <p><span style={{font: 'Droid Sans'}} /></p>
            <p className="chevron">Download our <a href="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/233/Word2013_TextBasics_Practice.docx">practice document</a>.</p>
            <p>If you click the link, your browser should prompt you to select one of two methods for downloading the file.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Open with</strong> will download the file and load it immediately in the specified program.</li>
              <li><strong>Save File</strong> will download it and save it to your hard drive.</li>
            </ul>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/save-or-open.jpg" alt="Dialog box with choice to Open with or Save File as" /></div>
            <p>Either way, once you click OK, the download begins. Your browser will indicate the progress and time remaining on the download.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/download-bar.jpg" alt="Download progress bar" /></div>
            <p>Once the download is complete, either the file will be saved to your computer or it will open in the program you selected. If you have trouble finding the file after you’ve downloaded it, check out our <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/techsavvy/finding-your-downloads/1">Finding Your Downloads</a> lesson.</p>
            <p className="moreInfo">Some browsers don’t always start this download process when you click the link to a file. In these cases, you can right-click the link, then click <strong>Save Link As</strong>, then select a location to download the file.</p>
            <h4>Uploading</h4>
            <p>If a site allows uploads, it will have an upload utility to help perform the file transfer. Each site handles this process differently, but we’ll give some common examples. Usually, the site will have help pages to walk you through the upload process.</p>
            <p>Many sites have an upload button that opens a dialog box. For example, Facebook has a camera icon that begins the upload process.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/upload-facebook.jpg" alt="Choose a file to upload on Facebook" /></div>
            <p>A dialog box will appear, prompting you to select a file. Browse to the location where your file is stored, select it, then click the Open button. Afterward, a progress bar tracking the upload process will appear on the page.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/select-a-cat-picture.jpg" alt="Select a file to upload" /></div>
            <p>Some sites support a drag-and-drop interface. For example, when logged in to Dropbox you can drag the files from a folder on your computer and drop them into the browser window.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/upload-dropbox.jpg" alt="Drag and drop upload interface on Dropbox" /></div>
            <p>Many other upload utilities have similar features. A more detailed example of uploading a file is available in our <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/googledriveanddocs">Google Drive tutorial</a>.</p>

            <h3>Using search engines</h3>
            <p>With billions of websites online today, there  is <strong>a lot </strong>of information on the Internet. <strong>Search engines </strong>make this information easier to find.  Let's look at the basics of <strong />using a search engine<strong />,<strong /> as w<strong />ell as some techniques you can use to get<strong> better search results</strong>.</p>
            <p className="chevron">Watch the video below to learn more about searching the Web.</p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/7RlB1CJovTs.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /></div>
            <h4>How to search the Web</h4>
            <p>There are many different search engines you can use, but some of the most popular include  <a target="_blank" title="Google" href="http://www.google.com/"><strong>Google</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>.  To perform a search, you'll need to navigate to a search engine in your web browser, type one or more<strong> keywords</strong>—also known as<strong> search terms</strong>—then press <strong>Enter</strong> on your keyboard. In this example, we'll search for <strong>recipes</strong>.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching for recipes on Google" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_start.png" /></div>
            <p>After you run a search, you'll see a list of <strong>relevant</strong><strong> websites</strong> that match your search terms. These are commonly known as  <strong>search results</strong>. If you see a site that looks interesting, you can click a link to open it. If the site doesn't have what you need, you can simply return to the results page to look for more options.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="search results on Google" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_results.png" /></div>
            <p>Most browsers also allow you to perform a web search directly from your <strong>address bar</strong>, although some have a separate <strong>search bar</strong> next to the address bar. Simply type your search terms and press <strong>Enter</strong> to run the search.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching from the address bar" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_address.png" /></div>
            <h4>Search suggestions</h4>
            <p>If you don't find  what you're looking for on the first try, don't worry! Search engines are good at finding things online, but they're not perfect. You'll often need to <strong>try</strong> <strong>different search terms</strong> to find what you're looking for.</p>
            <p>If you're having trouble thinking of new search terms, you can use <strong>search suggestions</strong> instead. These will usually appear as you're typing, and they're a great way to find new keywords you might not have tried otherwise. To use a search suggestion, you  can click it with your mouse,  or select it with the arrow keys on your keyboard.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="search suggestions in Google" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_suggest.png" /></div>
            <h4>Refining your search<br /><strong /></h4>
            <p>If you're still having trouble finding exactly what you need, you can use some special characters to help refine your search. For example, if you want to <strong>exclude a word </strong>from a search, you can type a <strong>hyphen</strong> (<strong>-</strong>) at the beginning of a word. So if you wanted to find cookie recipes that don't include chocolate, you could search for  <strong>recipes cookies</strong><strong> -chocolate</strong>.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching for cookies that don't contain chocolate" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_exclude.png" /></div>
            <p>You can also search for <strong>exact words</strong> or <strong>phrases</strong> to narrow down your results even more. All you need to do is place <strong>quotation marks</strong> (<strong />" "<strong />) around the desired search terms. For example, if you search for <strong>recipes</strong> <strong>"sugar cookies"</strong>, your search results will only include recipes for sugar cookies, instead of any cookies that happen to use sugar as an ingredient.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching for an exact match" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_exact.png" /></div>
            <p><span className="redactor-invisible-space" /></p>
            <p>These techniques may come in handy in certain cases, but you probably won't need to use them with most searches. Search engines can usually figure out what you're looking for without these extra characters. We recommend trying a few different <strong>search suggestions </strong>before using this method.   <br /></p>
            <h4>Content-specific searches</h4>
            <p>There may be times when you're looking for something more specific, like a <strong>news article</strong>, <strong>picture</strong>, or <strong>video</strong>. Most search engines have <strong>links</strong> at the top of the page that allow you to perform these unique searches.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="different types of web searches" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_types.png" /></div>
            <p>In the example below, we've used the same search terms to look for <strong>images</strong> instead of websites. If you see an image you like, you can click to visit the website it originally came from.    <br /></p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching for images" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_images.jpg" /></div>
            <p>You can use the extra<strong> search tools</strong> to narrow down your results even more. These tools will change based on the type of content you're looking for, but in this example we can filter our images by<strong> size</strong>, <strong>color</strong>,<strong /><strong> image type</strong>, and more. So if you wanted to find cookies with pink frosting, you could search for images that are mostly pink.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"> <img className="imageBorder" alt="searching for a specific color with search tools" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_pink.jpg" /><br /></div>
            <h4>Advertisements</h4>
            <p>One final thing to note: Most search engines include <strong>advertisements</strong> with search results. For example, you can see advertisements at the top of the search results below.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="adverstisements within search results" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_ads.png" /></div>
            <p>These ads are based on your search terms, and they often look similar to other search results. While they may be useful in some cases, it's usually more helpful to focus on the actual search results.</p>

            <h3>Using search engines</h3>
            <p>With billions of websites online today, there  is <strong>a lot </strong>of information on the Internet. <strong>Search engines </strong>make this information easier to find.  Let's look at the basics of <strong />using a search engine<strong />,<strong /> as w<strong />ell as some techniques you can use to get<strong> better search results</strong>.</p>
            <p className="chevron">Watch the video below to learn more about searching the Web.</p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/7RlB1CJovTs(1).html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /></div>
            <h4>How to search the Web</h4>
            <p>There are many different search engines you can use, but some of the most popular include  <a target="_blank" title="Google" href="http://www.google.com/"><strong>Google</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>.  To perform a search, you'll need to navigate to a search engine in your web browser, type one or more<strong> keywords</strong>—also known as<strong> search terms</strong>—then press <strong>Enter</strong> on your keyboard. In this example, we'll search for <strong>recipes</strong>.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching for recipes on Google" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_start.png" /></div>
            <p>After you run a search, you'll see a list of <strong>relevant</strong><strong> websites</strong> that match your search terms. These are commonly known as  <strong>search results</strong>. If you see a site that looks interesting, you can click a link to open it. If the site doesn't have what you need, you can simply return to the results page to look for more options.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="search results on Google" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_results.png" /></div>
            <p>Most browsers also allow you to perform a web search directly from your <strong>address bar</strong>, although some have a separate <strong>search bar</strong> next to the address bar. Simply type your search terms and press <strong>Enter</strong> to run the search.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching from the address bar" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_address.png" /></div>
            <h4>Search suggestions</h4>
            <p>If you don't find  what you're looking for on the first try, don't worry! Search engines are good at finding things online, but they're not perfect. You'll often need to <strong>try</strong> <strong>different search terms</strong> to find what you're looking for.</p>
            <p>If you're having trouble thinking of new search terms, you can use <strong>search suggestions</strong> instead. These will usually appear as you're typing, and they're a great way to find new keywords you might not have tried otherwise. To use a search suggestion, you  can click it with your mouse,  or select it with the arrow keys on your keyboard.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="search suggestions in Google" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_suggest.png" /></div>
            <h4>Refining your search<br /><strong /></h4>
            <p>If you're still having trouble finding exactly what you need, you can use some special characters to help refine your search. For example, if you want to <strong>exclude a word </strong>from a search, you can type a <strong>hyphen</strong> (<strong>-</strong>) at the beginning of a word. So if you wanted to find cookie recipes that don't include chocolate, you could search for  <strong>recipes cookies</strong><strong> -chocolate</strong>.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching for cookies that don't contain chocolate" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_exclude.png" /></div>
            <p>You can also search for <strong>exact words</strong> or <strong>phrases</strong> to narrow down your results even more. All you need to do is place <strong>quotation marks</strong> (<strong />" "<strong />) around the desired search terms. For example, if you search for <strong>recipes</strong> <strong>"sugar cookies"</strong>, your search results will only include recipes for sugar cookies, instead of any cookies that happen to use sugar as an ingredient.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching for an exact match" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/2016_search_exact.png" /></div>
            <p><span className="redactor-invisible-space" /></p>

            <h3>Understanding URLs</h3>
            <p>Every time you click a link on a website or type a web address into your browser, it’s a <strong>URL</strong>.  URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.  Think of it like a street address, with each portion of the URL as different parts of the address, and each giving you different information.  Let’s examine each component of a URL and what we can learn from it.</p>
            <p className="chevron">Watch the video below to learn the different parts of a URL.<br /></p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/5Jr-_Za5yQM.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /></div>
            <h4>Scheme</h4>
            <p>Every <strong>URL</strong> begins with the <strong>scheme</strong>.  This tells your browser what type of address it is so the browser connects to it correctly.  There are many types of schemes, but for typical web browsing you will mostly see <strong>http</strong> and <strong>https</strong>.  Your browser usually won’t show the scheme in the address bar, and usually you don’t need to type the scheme when typing a web address; instead, you can just begin with the <strong>domain name</strong>.  The scheme is still always part of the URL; it just isn’t being displayed.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img alt="Scheme of a URL" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/scheme.png" /></div>
            <h4>Domain name</h4>
            <p>The <strong>domain name</strong> is the most prominent part of a web address.  Typically, different pages on the same site will continue to use the same <strong>domain name</strong>.  For example, all pages on this site share the GCFLearnFree.org <strong>domain name</strong>.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/domanname.png" alt="Domain name of a URL" /></div>
            <p>Each segment of the <strong>domain name</strong> separated by a period is called a <strong>domain</strong>.  The domain on the right is called a <strong>top-level domain</strong>, with the domain to the left of it called the <strong>second-level domain</strong>, then <strong>third-level domain</strong>, and so on.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/domainname_image2.png" alt="Parts of a domain name" /></div>
            <p>You can often learn something about the site from the domains.  One of the domains usually identifies the organization, while the top-level domain may give you more general information on what kind of site it is.  For example, in the domain name <strong /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nc.gov/">nc.gov</a>, the <strong>.gov</strong> domain means it is a government website in the United States, the <strong>nc</strong> domain identifies it as the website of North Carolina.</p>
            <p>In most URLs, the <strong>www</strong> domain can be omitted. <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">Google.com</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">www.google.com</a> lead to the same page. However, other subdomains cannot be omitted. For example, all pages under <a href="http://news.google.com/" target="_blank">news.google.com</a> require the <strong>news</strong><strong /> subdomain in the URL.</p>
            <h4>File path</h4>
            <p>The <strong>file path</strong>—often just called the <strong>path</strong>—tells your browser to load a specific page.  If you don’t specify a <strong>path</strong> and only enter a <strong>domain name</strong>, your browser is still loading a specific page; it’s just loading a default page, which usually will help you navigate to other pages.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/filepath.png" alt="File path of a URL" /></div>
            <p>URLs that end with the <strong>domain name</strong> without a <strong>file path</strong> usually will load a homepage or an index page that's designed to help you navigate to specific pages on the site.  Often, if you can’t remember the file path for a specific page, you can go to the homepage and search for it.</p>
            <h4>Parameters</h4>
            <p>Some <strong>URLs</strong> include a string of characters after the path—beginning with a question mark—called the <strong>parameter string</strong>.  You have probably noticed this part of a <strong>URL</strong> appear in your address bar after performing a search on Google or YouTube.  The parameter string can be clear or confusing to a human user, but it is critical information for the server.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/parameters_image.png" alt="Parameters of a URL" /></div>
            <h4>Anchor</h4>
            <p>Also appearing after the path, the <strong>anchor</strong> tells your browser to scroll to or load a specific part of the page.  Usually the <strong>anchor</strong> begins with a hashtag and is used to direct your browser to a specific part of a very long page, much like a bookmark.  Different <strong>anchors</strong> don’t load different pages; they simply tell the browser to display different parts of the page.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/anchor_image.png" alt="Anchor of a URL" /></div>
            <h4>A whole URL</h4>
            <p>When combined, these elements make up a URL, although not all URLs will have all five parts.</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/fullurlending_image2.png" alt="viewing the whole URL" title="viewing the whole URL" /></div>
            <p>Using what we learned in this tutorial, we can tell from the domain name of this URL that it’s on Wikipedia, from the parameters that the page is probably about burritos, and from the anchor that we’ll be looking at the section on burritos for breakfast.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that these are the most common components of a URL.  There are many other parts, but these are the five you will see most often and that can usually give you the most information.</p>

            <p>The Internet is a really powerful tool. It gives us access to all kinds of information at a moment's notice—think email, Google search, and Wikipedia. So there's something a little counterintuitive about only being able to use the Internet when you sit down at a desktop computer. What if you could use the Internet from anywhere in your home or office?</p>
            <p>If you already have high-speed (broadband) Internet service at your house, it's pretty easy to create your own <strong>home wireless network</strong>. Commonly known as <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, a wireless network allows you to connect laptops, smartphones, and other mobile devices to your home Internet service without an Ethernet cable.</p>
            <h4>Purchase a wireless router</h4>
            <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 649, height: 452}} alt="a wireless router" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/wificonnect_router_image.png" width={649} height={452} /></div>
            <p>To create your own Wi-Fi network, you'll need a <strong>wireless router</strong>. This is the device that will broadcast the Wi-Fi signal from your Internet modem throughout your house. Your Internet service provider (ISP) may offer you a wireless router for a small monthly fee. If you've never set up a Wi-Fi network before, this may be the easiest option.</p>
            <p>If you want to buy your own router, we'd recommend spending a little more time researching different options. CNET offers a comprehensive guide on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/topics/networking/buying-guide/">How to Buy a Router</a>.</p>
            <p className="moreInfo">Some Internet modems may already have a built-in wireless router, which means you won't need to purchase a separate one. <br /></p>
            <h4>Connect the cables</h4>
            <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 674, height: 470}} alt="connecting the cables for a wi-fi router" src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/wificonnect_connect_image.png" width={674} height={470} /></div>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                <p>Once you've acquired a wireless router, you'll need to connect it to your existing Internet modem.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Connect an Ethernet cable from your modem to the wireless router (there is usually a short Ethernet cable included with your wireless router for this purpose).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Plug in the power cable for the wireless router.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Wait at least 30 to 60 seconds, and make sure the lights on your router are working correctly.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Configure your router</h4>
            <p>Next, you'll need to use your computer to configure your router's default settings. This includes setting a <strong>unique name</strong> and <strong>password</strong> for your wireless network.</p>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                <p>Using your web browser, enter the<strong> router's default IP address</strong> into the address bar, then press <strong>Enter</strong>. Your router's instructions should include this information, but some of the most common addresses include <strong>192.168.0.1</strong>, <strong>192.168.1.1</strong>, and <strong>192.168.2.1</strong>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The router's sign-in page will appear. Again, the exact sign-in details should be included with your router's instructions, but most routers use a standard user name and password combination, such as <strong>admin</strong> and <strong>password</strong>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Your router's settings page will appear. Locate and select the <strong>Network Name</strong> setting, then enter a unique network name.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Locate and select the<strong> Network Password</strong> setting, and choose an Encryption option. There are several types of <strong>encryption</strong> you can use, but we recommend <strong>WPA2</strong>, which is generally considered to be the most secure.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Enter your desired password. Make sure to use a <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/techsavvy/password-tips/1">strong password</a> to help ensure no one else can access your network.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Locate and select the <strong>Save</strong> button to save your settings.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Connect!</h4>
            <p>That's it! Now you're ready to connect to your Wi-Fi network and make sure it's working. The process for connecting to a Wi-Fi network will vary slightly depending on what type of computer or device you're using, but any system will require these basic steps.</p>
            <ol className="numbered-list">
              <li>
                <p>Locate your computer's network settings, and search for nearby Wi-Fi networks.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Select your network, and enter your password.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>If the connection is successful, open your web browser and try navigating to a webpage like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">www.google.com</a>. If the page loads, it means your Wi-Fi connection is working correctly.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Congratulations!</h4>
            <p>You've just set up your own home wireless network. Way to go!<br /></p>

            <p>The Internet is a really powerful tool. It gives us access to all kinds of information at a moment's notice—think email, Google search, and Wikipedia. So there's something a little counterintuitive about only being able to use the Internet when you sit down at a desktop computer. What if you could use the Internet from anywhere in your home or office?</p>
            <p>If you already have high-speed (broadband) Internet service at your house, it's pretty easy to create your own <strong>home wireless network</strong>.

            <h3>Choosing a web browser</h3>
            <p>A <strong>web browser</strong> is a type of software that allows you to find and view websites on the Internet. Even if you didn't know it, you're using a web browser right now to read this page! <br /></p>
            <p>For many years, especially in the early 2000s, there was one browser that almost everyone used: Microsoft's <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>. If you used the Internet at that time, you probably clicked an icon like this to access the Web:</p>
            <div className="centerImage"><img src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/ie.png" alt="the internet explorer icon" /></div>
            <p>In the past, Internet Explorer was pre-installed on any PC you buy. Starting in the mid-2000s, other software companies introduced new browsers, including <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> and <strong>Google Chrome</strong>. At the time, these browsers allowed for more experimental features. Because of this, web developers began creating websites with browsers like Chrome and Firefox in mind, which meant they didn't always work as well in Internet Explorer. If you have a PC with Windows 10, you'll have Microsoft Edge as your web browser instead. Watch this video to learn more about browsing in Edge.&nbsp;</p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/9r7-2ZbuzG8.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /></div>
            <p>It's always a good idea to keep <strong>at least two web browsers</strong> on your computer or mobile device. This way, if a website isn't working correctly you can try opening the page in a different web browser. More often than not, this trick can solve a lot of problems you might encounter online.<br /></p>

            </div>
            <h4>Using a PC or Android? Try Google Chrome.</h4>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> is probably the best web browser right now for PCs. It's free to download, it's very fast, and it's secure. Chrome is also the default web browser for many Android devices. Watch this video to learn about browsing in Chrome.&nbsp;</p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/a1HLhseDOCY.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /></div>
            <p>If you have a Google account, you can even sync your saved passwords and browsing history across multiple devices. And because it downloads updates automatically, you'll always be protected from current security threats and viruses online. If you want to learn more, review our <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/chrome">Chrome tutorial</a>.</p>
            <h4>Using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac? Try Safari.</h4>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/safari">Safari</a> is the default web browser for Mac computers and iOS devices, including the iPhone and iPad. Aside from being fast and secure, Safari has a lot of unique features. For example, Reader view allows you to see a simplified version of a webpage that's optimized for reading. It's also easy to add articles you find to your Reading List so you can save them for later. Watch this video to learn more about browsing in Safari.&nbsp;</p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/WKiHbJfYkMA.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /></div>
            <p>Again, we recommend keeping at least two web browsers on your device. Chrome is a good secondary browser to use on a Mac, iPhone, or iPad. It's also important to note that you cannot use Internet Explorer on a Mac or iOS device.</p>
            <h4>Other recommended web browsers</h4>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a>: This free web browser from Mozilla works on Windows, Mac, and Android. It's built by an open-source community of developers, so it will usually support even the most experimental web features. Like Chrome,  it will be updated automatically, so you'll be protected from viruses and other threats online. Next, watch this video about browsing in Firefox.</p>
            <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Internet Basics_ Using Search Engines_files/dX7WoKjCY1o.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /><br /></div>
            <p>If you want to learn more, review our <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/firefox">Firefox tutorial</a>.</p>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>: Originally released in 1994, the Opera web browser has been around much longer than Firefox and Chrome. You may find that some websites don't load perfectly on Opera, but it's still regarded as a fast and secure alternative to your default browser. It's also available for all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS).</p>
