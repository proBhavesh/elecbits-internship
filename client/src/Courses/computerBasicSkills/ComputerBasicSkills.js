              <h3>Getting started with your first computer</h3>
              <p>A computer is more than just another household appliance. The vast amount of information and possibilities can be overwhelming. But you can accomplish a lot with a computer, and using one can be a good experience. Let's walk through getting started with your first computer.</p>
              <p className="attention">Turning on a computer for the first time can be different from one computer to the next. Your experience could be different from this lesson. It's OK to ask someone for help.<br /></p>
              <h4>Turning on a computer</h4>
              <p>The very first step is to turn on the computer. Make sure all the cables are plugged in correctly, and locate the power button. It's in a different place on every computer, but it will have the universal power button symbol (shown below).</p>
              <div><img style={{boxShadow: 'none'}} alt="Image of a power button icon" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/reset_button.jpg" width={100} height={105} /></div>
              <p>Once turned on, your computer takes time before it's ready to use. You may see a few different displays flash on the screen. This process is called <strong>booting up</strong>, and it can take anywhere from 15 seconds to several minutes.</p>
              <p>Once the computer has <strong>booted up</strong>, it may be ready to use, or it may require you to <strong>log in</strong>. This means identifying yourself by typing your user name or selecting your profile, then typing your password. If you've never logged in to your computer before, you may need to create an account.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 800, height: 447}} alt="A login screen on a laptop computer" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/login_screen_image.png" width={800} height={447} /></div>
              <h4>The keyboard and mouse</h4>
              <p> You interact with a computer mainly by using the <strong>keyboard</strong> and <strong>mouse,</strong> or a <strong>trackpad</strong> on laptops. Learning to use these devices is essential to learning to use a computer. Most people find it comfortable to place the keyboard on the desk directly in front of them and the mouse to one side of the keyboard.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 800, height: 447}} alt="Hands on keyboard positioned in front of a computer" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/keyboardandmouse_handsonkeyboard.png" width={800} height={447} /></div>
              <p>The mouse controls the <strong>pointer</strong> on the screen. Whenever you move the mouse across the desk, the pointer will move in a similar manner. A mouse usually has two buttons, which are referred to as the left button and the right button. You will often interact with the computer by moving the mouse pointer over something on the computer screen, then clicking one of the buttons.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 800, height: 447}} alt="Hand on mouse controlling the pointer on the screen" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/keyboardandmouse_handsonmouse.png" width={800} height={447} /></div>
              <p>On laptops, you can use the <strong>trackpad</strong>, located below the keyboard, instead of a mouse. Simply drag your finger across the trackpad to move the <strong>pointer</strong> on the screen. Some trackpads do not have buttons, so you'll either press or tap the <strong />trackpad to click.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 800, height: 447}} alt="Hand clicking the trackpad" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/keyboardandmouse_trackpad.png" width={800} height={447} /></div>
              <p>The keyboard allows you to type letters, numbers, and words into the computer. Whenever you see a flashing vertical line—called the <strong>cursor</strong>—you can start typing.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 560, height: 152}} alt="A blinking cursor in a browser's address bar" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/keyboardandmouse_cursor1cropped.gif" width={560} height={152} /></div>
              <p className="attention">Note that the <strong>mouse pointer</strong> is also called a <strong>cursor</strong>, but it is shaped differently. The <strong>keyboard cursor</strong> is also called the <strong>insertion point</strong>.<br /></p>
              <h4>Using a computer</h4>
              <p>The main screen you'll start from is the <strong>desktop</strong>. This is sort of like a main menu or a table of contents. From here, you can access the programs and features you need to use your computer.</p>
              <p><strong>Icons</strong> are used to represent the different files, applications, and commands on your computer. An icon is a small image that's intended to give you an idea at a glance of what it represents, like a logo. Double-clicking an icon on the desktop will open that application or file.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 800, height: 450}} alt="Icons on a desktop" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/usingacomputer_icons_cropped2.jpg" width={800} height={450} /></div>
              <p>A <strong>button</strong> is a command that performs a specific function within an application. The most commonly used commands in a program will be represented by buttons.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 800, height: 380}} alt="Mouse cursor over a button" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/usingacomputer_buttons_cropped2.jpg" width={800} height={380} /></div>
              <p><strong>Menus</strong> are organized collections of commands and shortcuts. Click a <strong>menu</strong> to open it and display the commands and shortcuts within. Then click an item in the <strong>menu</strong> to execute it.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img alt="Mouse cursor over a menu" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/usingacomputer_menu_cropped2.png" /></div>
              <p>When you open an application or folder, it is displayed in its own <strong>window</strong>. A <strong>window</strong> is a contained area—like a picture within a picture—with its own menus and buttons specific to that program. You can rearrange multiple <strong>windows</strong> on the desktop and switch between them.</p>
              <div className="centerImage" />
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 799, height: 384}} alt="Multiple windows over a desktop" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/usingacomputer_multiplewindows_cropped.png" width={799} height={384} /></div>

              <h3>How to use your computer's built-in help</h3>
              <p>Everyone needs to look for help sometimes. Luckily, when you want help with a computer program, it’s usually easy to find. Most programs have a help feature somewhere, and learning how to use it can make a big difference. You may not find everything you need, but your computer’s built-in help is a great place to start.</p>
              <p>Different programs integrate help features in different ways. Some are like interactive manuals included with the program that you can open with a menu, while others are just links to the developer’s support website. But they’re always designed with the same thing in mind: to help you learn the features of the program and to solve problems yourself.<br /></p>
              <h4>How to access built-in help</h4>
              <p>Most programs have one of two ways to access built-in help. For example, Adobe Photoshop Elements has a <strong>Help</strong> menu with a variety of options. Many of these options open Adobe’s support page in your web browser, while others access features within the program itself. <br /></p>
              <div><img src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/computer_help.jpg" alt="Help menu in Photoshop Elements" title="Help menu in Photoshop Elements" /></div>
              <p>Other programs have a help button. For example, Microsoft Office 2016 has the Help tab with a Help button to open a search.</p>
              <div><img src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/computer_help_excel.jpg" alt="Help tab then the Help button in Excel" title="Help tab then the Help button in Excel" /></div>
              <h4>Features of a help file</h4>
              <p>Help files can be organized in a variety of ways, including as a table of contents, FAQ, or searchable database.</p>
              <p>When you open the help panel in Office 2016, you'll see a search box. Much like a search engine, you type keywords in the search bar, and it will display topics relevant to the keywords you entered. <br /></p>
              <div><img src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/computer_help_column_width.jpg" style={{width: 489, height: '543.817px'}} alt="Help panel and search" title="Help panel and search" width={489} height="543.817" /></div>
              <p>The table of contents for Mozilla’s support page is a broad list of categories. Clicking any of these hyperlinks will lead to a list of narrower topics and specific help articles. There’s also a search bar to help you. <br /></p>
              <div><img src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/computer_help_mozzilla_support.jpg" alt="Mozilla Support search" title="Mozilla Support search" /></div>
              <p>Although built-in help can be useful, it may not always have the information you want. If you can’t find what you’re looking for or don’t understand what you've found, you can usually ask someone you know, do a Google search, or contact support staff. It can take a little extra time and effort, but learning how to find solutions on your own is a valuable skill—and you’ll get better at it with practice.</p>

              <h3>Undo your mistakes</h3>
              <p>Have you ever made a big mistake while doing work on a computer and wished it hadn’t happened? Don’t worry, there’s a feature that can help.</p>
              <p>Most programs have an <strong>Undo</strong> command that reverts back to the last change you made to your current project. If your last change was adding or pasting text into a document, Undo will delete it. If your last change was deleting something, Undo will restore it. This can come in handy when you accidentally overwrite a big chunk of a document, and just knowing this feature is available can be a big relief.</p>
              <p>The Undo function is most commonly found in the <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="Undo in Edit menu" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/undo menu.png" /></div>
              <p>Many programs have an Undo button on the toolbar that usually resembles a curved arrow pointing left, like this one in Google Docs.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/undo button bigger.png" alt="Undo button" /></div>
              <p><strong>Ctrl+Z</strong> (or <strong>Command+Z</strong> on a Mac) is a common keyboard shortcut for Undo.</p>
              <p>Usually, programs with the Undo function keep track of not just your most recent change but an entire series of your most recent changes. For example, if you paste a picture in a document and type a caption under it, using Undo once will remove the caption you typed, while using Undo a second time will remove the picture you pasted. Keep in mind that these programs only keep track of your previous changes for as long as the program is open. If you close the file and open it again, you won’t be able to undo previous changes.</p>
              <p className="moreInfo">Many programs also have a <strong>Redo</strong> function, which will undo your last undo. If you use Undo but then realize you didn’t want to Undo your most recent change, Redo will restore it.</p>
              <p>Many types of programs use Undo functions, including word processors, image editors, email clients, and some file-management programs. It’s an almost universal feature in computer software. Once you become used to how Undo works, you won’t need to worry about losing work due to simple mistakes.</p>

              <h3>Understanding file extensions</h3>
              <p>Your computer has many different types of files on it, and each one has its own <strong>file extension</strong>. A file extension is a three- or four-letter identifier found at the end of a file name and following a period. These extensions tell you about the characteristics of a file and its use. In this lesson, we'll go over some examples of these extensions, as well as how to determine a particular file's extension.</p>
              <h4>Examples of file extensions</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>A JPEG uses the <strong>.jpg</strong> or <strong>.jpeg </strong>extension (for example, <strong>image.jpg</strong>).</li>
                <li>A Word document uses the <strong>.docx</strong> extension, or <strong>.doc</strong> for older versions (for example, <strong>CoverLetter.docx</strong>).</li>
                <li>An MP3 audio file uses the <strong>.mp3</strong> extension (for example, <strong>rhyme_rap.mp3</strong>).</li>
                <li>An Excel spreadsheet uses the <strong>.xlsx</strong> extension, or <strong>.xls</strong> for older versions (for example, <strong>budget.xls</strong>).</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Hidden file extensions</h4>
              <p>Some operating systems hide file extensions by default to reduce clutter. It is possible to show the file extensions if they're hidden. Click the links below to see how to show file extensions in Windows and macOS:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://kb.winzip.com/kb/entry/26/">Windows</a></li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/show-or-hide-filename-extensions-on-mac-mchlp2304/mac">macOS</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also usually tell what the file type is by looking at the <strong>file's icon</strong>. For example, the Word document looks like a file with a W in the corner, while an Excel spreadsheet looks like a file with an X in the corner.</p>

              <p className="moreInfo">File extensions also tell your computer which applications to use when opening that file. Sometime you may want to use <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/opening-files-with-different-applications/1/">a different application to open that file</a>.</p>

              <div className="centerImage"><img alt="Abstract diagram of downloading and uploading" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/intro_imagev2.png" /></div>
              <p>While exploring the Internet, you’ve probably encountered the terms <strong>downloading</strong> and <strong>uploading</strong>. <strong>Downloading</strong> means receiving data or a file from the Internet on your computer. <strong>Uploading</strong> means sending data or a file from your computer to somewhere on the Internet.</p>
              <p>These terms describe activities you may have already learned how to do. If you've ever opened an example document in one of our tutorials, you've downloaded that file. If you’ve ever shared a photo you took on Facebook or another social media site, you've uploaded that photo.</p>
              <h4>Downloading</h4>
              <p>Usually, when you download a file you will start the download by clicking a link to that file. Many of our tutorials contain links to files, like this:</p>
              <p><span style={{font: 'Droid Sans'}} /></p>
              <p className="chevron">Download our <a href="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/233/Word2013_TextBasics_Practice.docx">practice document</a>.</p>
              <p>If you click the link, your browser should prompt you to select one of two methods for downloading the file.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Open with</strong> will download the file and load it immediately in the specified program.</li>
                <li><strong>Save File</strong> will download it and save it to your hard drive.</li>
              </ul>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/save-or-open.jpg" alt="Dialog box with choice to Open with or Save File as" /></div>
              <p>Either way, once you click OK, the download begins. Your browser will indicate the progress and time remaining on the download.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/download-bar.jpg" alt="Download progress bar" /></div>
              <p>Once the download is complete, either the file will be saved to your computer or it will open in the program you selected. If you have trouble finding the file after you’ve downloaded it, check out our <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/techsavvy/finding-your-downloads/1">Finding Your Downloads</a> lesson.</p>
              <p className="moreInfo">Some browsers don’t always start this download process when you click the link to a file. In these cases, you can right-click the link, then click <strong>Save Link As</strong>, then select a location to download the file.</p>
              <h4>Uploading</h4>
              <p>If a site allows uploads, it will have an upload utility to help perform the file transfer. Each site handles this process differently, but we’ll give some common examples. Usually, the site will have help pages to walk you through the upload process.</p>
              <p>Many sites have an upload button that opens a dialog box. For example, Facebook has a camera icon that begins the upload process.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/upload-facebook.jpg" alt="Choose a file to upload on Facebook" /></div>
              <p>A dialog box will appear, prompting you to select a file. Browse to the location where your file is stored, select it, then click the Open button. Afterward, a progress bar tracking the upload process will appear on the page.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/select-a-cat-picture.jpg" alt="Select a file to upload" /></div>
              <p>Some sites support a drag-and-drop interface. For example, when logged in to Dropbox you can drag the files from a folder on your computer and drop them into the browser window.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/upload-dropbox.jpg" alt="Drag and drop upload interface on Dropbox" /></div>
              <p>Many other upload utilities have similar features. A more detailed example of uploading a file is available in our <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/googledriveanddocs">Google Drive tutorial</a>.</p>

              <h3>Free software</h3>
              <div className="centerImage"><img alt="A smartphone surrounded by icons of apps" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/freesoftware_intro_image.png" /></div>
              <p>There are free programs available for almost any purpose you can imagine.  If you're looking for free software for a specific task or want to find a free alternative to an expensive commercial program, it's probably somewhere on the Internet.  Often, the most difficult part is finding the safest, most reliable free programs among the thousands of other free programs.</p>
              <p>Usually, the best way to find free software for Windows is to do an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/digitalskills/searchbetter">Internet search</a>.  On Android and iOS devices, the best way to find free software is to search in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/devices/androidbasics/7">Play Store</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/devices/ipadbasics/7">App Store</a> for apps that are listed as free.  For Mac OS, both the App Store and Internet searches are effective methods for finding free software.<br /></p>
              <p className="moreInfo">When there is no fee to use software, it is sometimes called <strong>software gratis</strong> or <strong>freeware</strong>.</p>
              <h4>Safely searching for free software</h4>
              <p>When searching for free software, distinguishing good software from bad or dangerous software is crucial.  These steps will help you find a program that is safe, reliable, and performs the functions you need.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify your needs</strong> and the tasks you are trying to accomplish.  Do you need a simple tool or something very powerful?  Are you trying to perform a specialized task, or are you looking for something generally useful?  Are you just looking to save money?</li>
                <li><strong>Search for information</strong> on a program before downloading it.  Determine if the publisher is reliable and well-liked, and if the program is safe and stable and has the features you want.</li>
                <li><strong>Read reviews</strong> on neutral third-party sites; a publisher may remove negative reviews from its own site.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't click misleading advertisements</strong> designed to look like download links or error messages.  Carefully examine download links before clicking, or <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/chrome/how-to-block-ads-in-your-web-browser/1/">install an adblocker</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid malware</strong> included in installers.  If an installer has options for custom search bars or other programs that seem unrelated, tell it not to install these.</li>
                <li><strong>Download directly from the developer's website</strong> rather than from a third-party site.  Many—but not all—third-party file hosting sites include malware with their installers.</li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internetsafety/3.2"><strong>Scan for viruses and malware</strong></a> immediately after installing a new program.  It's better to avoid installing malware, but scans will probably catch anything you missed.</li>
              </ul>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="Misleading ads on a download page" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/misleading-ads-2.jpg" /></div>
              <p><br />In the image above, the download button at the bottom-left is the real download link, while the other two are misleading ads.</p>
              <p>Keep in mind that these safety tips are good practices whether you're downloading free software or paying for software.  There's nothing stopping a distributor from bundling malware with a program and still charging you a fee for it, and plenty of commercial software is unstable or ineffective.  Be aware at all times of common unscrupulous practices so you can avoid them and choose the best software for your needs.</p>
              <h4>Examples of free software</h4>
              <p>One of the biggest advantages of free software is determining your specific needs and searching for the program that's right for you, but sometimes it's helpful to see what software other people are using.  Here's a list of some of our favorite free software for common tasks.</p>

              </ul>
              <h4>Why is some software free?</h4>
              <p>There are many reasons a developer may not be charging a fee for its software.  In most cases, developers are still earning money through other means.  Here are some of the common ways free software still makes money.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Donations</strong>: The software is free, but users can donate money to support the developer.</li>
                <li><strong>Advertisements</strong>: The developer is paid by other companies to place advertisements in the software or on its website.</li>
                <li><strong>Data mining</strong>: The software collects information about users and sells this to advertisers or marketing researchers. This is often used in combination with advertisements.</li>
                <li><strong>Bundling other software</strong>: Other software distributors pay the developer to bundle other programs with its software.  This often includes malware.</li>
                <li><strong>In-app purchases</strong>: The base software is free, but users can pay fees to unlock additional features.</li>
                <li><strong>Premium products or subscriptions</strong>: The software itself is free, but the developer sells more advanced versions of the program or other programs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Not all free software developers earn money from software.  They may have full-time jobs and make software in their free time as a hobby, they may be working under a license that prohibits earning profit from the software, or they might just enjoy participating in free software communities on the Internet.</p>
              <p>Some software is freely available because the developers adhere to certain social and ethical guidelines.  This software is sometimes called <strong>software libre</strong>, although it's also sometimes called <strong>free software</strong>, using the definition of <strong>free</strong> that means <strong>liberty</strong>, not <strong>free of charge</strong>.  You can read more about this type of free software at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Foundation</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software Foundation</a>.</p>
              <h4>Support free software developers</h4>
              <p>After using free software for a while, if you are happy with the programs consider supporting their developers.  Visit their websites, and look for ways you can help.  They may have links for you to donate money, contribute your talents to their projects, or promote their software on social media.  But remember, your support is a choice, not an obligation.  Free software communities thrive on individual choice and mutual assistance.</p>

              <h3>Open source vs. closed source software</h3>
              <p>Almost every piece of computer software is created using <strong>source code</strong>, which is the technical blueprint that tells a program how to function. When creators release their finished product to the public, they must decide whether to make its code open source or closed source.</p>
              <p className="chevron">Watch the video below to learn more about open source and closed source software. </p>
              <div className="video-embed"><iframe style={{width: 853, height: 480}} src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/2q91vTvc7YE.html" allowFullScreen frameBorder={0} /><br /></div>
              <h4>What is open source and closed source?</h4>
              <p>With <strong>closed source software</strong> (also known as proprietary software), the public is not given access to the source code, so they can’t see or modify it in any way. </p>
              <div><img src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/no_access_code.png" /></div>
              <p>But with <strong>open source software</strong>, the source code is publicly available to anyone who wants it, and programmers can read or change that code if they desire. Keep in mind that you don’t have to read or modify any code in order to use an open source product.</p>
              <h4>Which type is more common?</h4>
              <p>The <strong>vast majority</strong> of apps, games, and other popular software is closed source. However, there are <strong>open source options</strong> for many types of programs. 
                If you want an open source alternative to Microsoft Office, you could use LibreOffice. Instead of using Windows, you could try an open source Linux operating system. Other common open source examples include the Firefox web browser and WordPress blogging platform.
              </p>
              <h4>What are the pros and cons?</h4>
              <p>One of open source’s biggest advantages is that it’s <strong>usually free</strong>, although some features and technical support may cost extra. Also, because the code is available to anyone who wants it, <strong>public collaboration</strong> can fix bugs, add features, and improve performance within a relatively short amount of time. 
                <br />
              </p>
              <div><img src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/programmers_open.png" /></div>
              <p>However, open source software isn’t perfect. <strong>It may not be as user friendly</strong> as closed source software, and if you run into trouble it may be difficult to find technical support, especially for less popular programs. </p>
              <p>Closed source software is more likely to be a <strong>stable, focused product</strong>, and if you need support customer service is typically easier to access. However, closed source software <strong>often costs money</strong>, and if it has any bugs or missing features you’ll have to wait on the creator to address the problems.<br /></p>
              <p>Now that you understand the difference between open and closed source software, you can take advantage of the type that best meets your needs.

              <h3>What is a PDF file?</h3>
              <p><strong>Adobe PDF</strong> files<strong />—short for<strong> portable document format</strong> files—<span className="redactor-invisible-space" />are one of the most commonly used file types today. If you've ever downloaded a printable form or document from the Web, such as an <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Forms-&-Pubs" target="_blank">IRS tax form</a>, there's a good chance it was a PDF file. Whenever you see a file that ends with <strong>.pdf</strong>, that means it's a PDF file.</p>
              <h4>Why use PDF files?</h4>
              <p>Let's say you create a newsletter in Microsoft Word and share it as a <strong>.docx file</strong>, which is the default file format for Word documents. Unless everyone has Microsoft Word installed on their computers, there's no guarantee that they would be able to open and view the newsletter. And because Word documents are meant to be edited, there's a chance that some of the formatting and text in your document may be shifted around.</p>
              <p> By contrast, PDF files are primarily meant for<strong> viewing, not editing</strong>. One reason they're so popular is that PDFs can <strong>preserve document formatting</strong>, which makes them more shareable and helps them to look the same on any device. Sharing the newsletter as a <strong>PDF file</strong> would help ensure everyone is able to view it as you intended.</p>
              <h4>Opening PDF files</h4>
              <p>Opening and viewing a PDF file is pretty simple. Most modern web browsers will open PDF files <strong>directly in your browser window </strong>instead of downloading them to your computer. If your browser can't do this, it should prompt you to download the file instead. Try clicking <a target="_blank" href="https://gcflearnfree.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Info%20Pages/Assets/GCF%20Flyer%202014_english.pdf">this link</a> to see how it works on your computer.</p>
              <p>If you need to view a PDF file just once, it's usually easiest to open it in your web browser. If you need to access the PDF later, you'll want to save a copy to your computer. This process will vary depending on your web browser, but in the example below the <strong>Save PDF button</strong> can be found near the upper-right corner.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="viewing a PDF in a browser window" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/browser.png" style={{width: 822, height: 544}} width={822} height={544} /></div>
              <p>If the PDF file is already on your computer, you can simply <strong>double-click to open it </strong>with the default PDF application.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="opening a PDF file saved to a computer" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/desktop.png" /></div>
              <p>If your computer uses Windows 7 or earlier, you may need to download a free PDF viewer (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/">Adobe Reader</a>) before you can view PDF files.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/adobe_reader.png" alt="downloading Adobe Reader" style={{width: 790, height: 429}} width={790} height={429} /></div>
              <h4>Editing PDF files</h4>
              <p>As we mentioned earlier, PDFs are primarily meant for<strong> </strong>viewing, not editing. However, there may be times when you encounter a PDF that allows you to enter certain information, like name and address. These PDFs use a special feature called <strong>form fields</strong>, which allow you to type new information into the document and save your changes. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf">this PDF</a> contains several form fields for entering your name, address, and other information.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="editing a PDF with form fields" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/form_fields.png" style={{width: 778, height: 309}} width={778} height={309} /></div>
              <p className="moreInfo">This feature is not supported in all web browsers, so you may need to download the PDF before you can use form fields to add your information.</p>
              <p>There may also be times when you want to make <strong>small</strong> <strong>edits</strong> to PDF files, like adding a comment or highlighting text.

              <h4>Creating PDF files</h4>
              <p>There are several ways to create PDF files, but the method will largely depend on the device you're using. For example, if you're using Windows 10 you can go to the <strong>Print dialog box</strong>, then <strong>select PDF from the list of printers</strong> at the top<strong />. This allows you to create a PDF of anything you would normally be able to print, including documents, emails, and webpages.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="using the Print dialog box to create a PDF file" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/print_pdf_win10.png" /></div>
              <p className="moreInfo">If you're on a Mac, the Print dialog box has a PDF menu that allows you to save a file as a PDF.<br /></p>
              <p>If your computer has Windows 8 or earlier, you have a few options. The simplest method is to use software that supports a <strong>PDF export</strong>, such as Microsoft Office or Google Chrome.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="exporting a PDF document from Microsoft Word" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/save_export_click_edit.png" /></div>
              <p>Another option is to use a <strong>PDF converter</strong> like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smallpdf.com/">Smallpdf</a>, which is a free app that runs in your web browser. Smallpdf can convert various file types<strong />—such as Microsoft Office documents<strong />—into a PDF format.</p>
              <p><img className="imageBorder" alt="the SmallPDF.com website" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/small_pdf.png" style={{width: 679, height: 394}} width={679} height={394} /></p>

              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 669, height: 466}} alt="wi-fi connected devices" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/wificonnect_intro_image.png" width={669} height={466} /></div>
              <p>The Internet is a really powerful tool. It gives us access to all kinds of information at a moment's notice—think email, Google search, and Wikipedia. So there's something a little counterintuitive about only being able to use the Internet when you sit down at a desktop computer. What if you could use the Internet from anywhere in your home or office?</p>
              <p>If you already have high-speed (broadband) Internet service at your house, it's pretty easy to create your own <strong>home wireless network</strong>. Commonly known as <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, a wireless network allows you to connect laptops, smartphones, and other mobile devices to your home Internet service without an Ethernet cable.</p>
              <h4>Purchase a wireless router</h4>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 649, height: 452}} alt="a wireless router" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/wificonnect_router_image.png" width={649} height={452} /></div>
              <p>To create your own Wi-Fi network, you'll need a <strong>wireless router</strong>. This is the device that will broadcast the Wi-Fi signal from your Internet modem throughout your house. Your Internet service provider (ISP) may offer you a wireless router for a small monthly fee. If you've never set up a Wi-Fi network before, this may be the easiest option.</p>
              <p>If you want to buy your own router, we'd recommend spending a little more time researching different options. CNET offers a comprehensive guide on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/topics/networking/buying-guide/">How to Buy a Router</a>.</p>
              <p className="moreInfo">Some Internet modems may already have a built-in wireless router, which means you won't need to purchase a separate one. <br /></p>
              <h4>Connect the cables</h4>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 674, height: 470}} alt="connecting the cables for a wi-fi router" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/wificonnect_connect_image.png" width={674} height={470} /></div>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li>
                  <p>Once you've acquired a wireless router, you'll need to connect it to your existing Internet modem.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Connect an Ethernet cable from your modem to the wireless router (there is usually a short Ethernet cable included with your wireless router for this purpose).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Plug in the power cable for the wireless router.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Wait at least 30 to 60 seconds, and make sure the lights on your router are working correctly.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Configure your router</h4>
              <p>Next, you'll need to use your computer to configure your router's default settings. This includes setting a <strong>unique name</strong> and <strong>password</strong> for your wireless network.</p>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li>
                  <p>Using your web browser, enter the<strong> router's default IP address</strong> into the address bar, then press <strong>Enter</strong>. Your router's instructions should include this information, but some of the most common addresses include <strong>192.168.0.1</strong>, <strong>192.168.1.1</strong>, and <strong>192.168.2.1</strong>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The router's sign-in page will appear. Again, the exact sign-in details should be included with your router's instructions, but most routers use a standard user name and password combination, such as <strong>admin</strong> and <strong>password</strong>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Your router's settings page will appear. Locate and select the <strong>Network Name</strong> setting, then enter a unique network name.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Locate and select the<strong> Network Password</strong> setting, and choose an Encryption option. There are several types of <strong>encryption</strong> you can use, but we recommend <strong>WPA2</strong>, which is generally considered to be the most secure.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Enter your desired password. Make sure to use a <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/techsavvy/password-tips/1">strong password</a> to help ensure no one else can access your network.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Locate and select the <strong>Save</strong> button to save your settings.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Connect!</h4>
              <p>That's it! Now you're ready to connect to your Wi-Fi network and make sure it's working. The process for connecting to a Wi-Fi network will vary slightly depending on what type of computer or device you're using, but any system will require these basic steps.</p>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li>
                  <p>Locate your computer's network settings, and search for nearby Wi-Fi networks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Select your network, and enter your password.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>If the connection is successful, open your web browser and try navigating to a webpage like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">www.google.com</a>. If the page loads, it means your Wi-Fi connection is working correctly.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Congratulations!</h4>
              <p>You've just set up your own home wireless network. Way to go!<br /></p>

              <h3>How to update your software</h3>
              <p>Keeping your software up to date is a crucial practice in Internet safety.  Most software updates automatically by default, but you should know how to check the updates and begin the process yourself.  Knowing how to keep your software updated can improve your computer's stability and security and let you know about new features, helping you be an informed and empowered user.</p>
              <p className="moreInfo">You can read more about Internet safety practices <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internetsafety">here</a>.</p>
              <h4>Update your operating system</h4>
              <p>Keeping your operating system updated is one of the most important steps in protecting yourself from viruses, malware, and other Internet security threats.</p>
              <h4>Windows</h4>
              <p>To update Windows, first open the Control Panel.  If you don't know where the <strong>Control Panel</strong> is, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/adjusting-your-settings/1/">this lesson in Windows Basics</a>.  In the search bar in the Control Panel, type <strong>update</strong>. Under <strong>Windows Update</strong>, click <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 800, height: 349}} className="imageBorder" alt="Under Windows Updates, clicking check for updates" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/control-panel.jpg" width={800} height={349} /></div>
              <p>It may take a moment for Windows to search for updates.  Once it does, if there are any updates available it will prompt you to install them.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 800, height: 320}} className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/windows-update.jpg" alt="Clicking Install updates" width={800} height={320} /></div>
              <p>It may take a while to install all the updates.  It's safe to leave the computer and do something else while it finishes.  Once it's done, Windows will probably prompt you to restart the computer.  If you need to do anything else after this, Windows will prompt you; otherwise, you're up to date!</p>
              <h4>macOS</h4>
              <p>To update macOS, open the App Store, then click Updates at the top. macOS updates will be at the top of the list of available updates.  On the right side of the screen, there are buttons to update individual apps or to apply all available updates.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 820, height: 412}} className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/os-x-app-store-update.jpg" alt="Mac App Store update page" width={820} height={412} /></div>
              <p>Apple has an excellent <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541">support page on how to check for updates</a> for macOS and apps.<br /></p>
              <h4>Update your apps</h4>
              <p>For many apps, regular updates provide new features and stability rather than security patches, so it isn't necessary to update them as frequently.  However, for more essential software like web browsers and antivirus software, security updates are just as critical as operating system updates.</p>
              <p>Many apps in both macOS and Windows will automatically check for updates when you open them.  If you installed them through the App Store or another distribution platform, the program will alert you about updates.  For standalone programs, take time to explore the program's menus and learn how to run the update process.</p>
              <p>For example, in Avast! Free Antivirus, there is an Update page on the Settings screen.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/virus-definitions-update.jpg" alt="Update virus definitions in Avast!" /></div>
              <p>However, in Firefox, the About Firefox screen in the Help menu also checks for updates.</p>

              <h3>How to customize your desktop background</h3>
              <p>Want your computer to feel a bit more like, well, <em>your</em> computer? You might want to consider changing your wallpaper.</p>
              <p>The wallpaper is the image that appears behind the icons on your computer's desktop—that's why it's usually called a desktop background. On most computers, you can change your background by right-clicking the desktop and selecting <strong>Personalize</strong>.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="personalizing the desktop" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/personalize.jpg" /></div>
              <p>Then select <strong>Desktop Background</strong>. By default, you'll see the images that were included with your computer.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 777, height: 506}} className="imageBorder" alt="changing the desktop background" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/dialog.jpg" width={777} height={506} /></div>
              <p>If you're looking for something specific, might we suggest <a target="_blank" href="http://images.google.com/">Google Image Search</a>? Its custom search tools allow you to search for images by size, which is perfect when you're looking for a large picture (we recommend an image that's <strong>at least 1024 x 768</strong>).<strong /> Anything smaller will look pixelated or grainy when stretched across your desktop.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 772, height: 416}} className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/google.jpg" alt="searching Google Images" width={772} height={416} /></div>
              <p>When you find an image you like, just select it and choose <strong>View image</strong>.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 770, height: 510}} className="imageBorder" alt="clicking view image" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/viewimage.jpg" width={770} height={510} /></div>
              <p>Then click and drag the picture to your desktop.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 817, height: 577}} className="imageBorder" alt="dragging the image to the desktop" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/drag.jpg" width={817} height={577} /></div>
              <p>You can now set the image as your desktop background. Right-click the image and select <strong>Set as desktop background</strong>.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="setting the desktop background" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/set.jpg" /></div>
              <p>You can use this same technique to turn any of your personal photos into a desktop background.</p>

              <p><strong>Computer viruses</strong> can be dangerous and should be taken seriously, but there are ways to remove them before serious damage is done.  We'll go through the basic steps of <strong>virus scanning</strong> and removal, but keep in mind that it may still be necessary to hire a technical support professional to completely remove the virus and repair your computer.</p>
              <h4>Antivirus software</h4>
              <p>First, if you don't already have an <strong>antivirus program</strong>, install one.  Be sure you only have one antivirus program installed because having more than one can cause significant problems. Examples of antivirus software include <a href="http://www.bitdefender.com/" target="_blank">Bitdefender</a> and <a href="http://us.norton.com/index.jsp" target="_blank">Norton</a>.</p>
              <h4>Run a system scan</h4>
              <p>Once you've verified that your antivirus program is running, begin a scan.  If you're unsure how to do this, review the documentation for your antivirus program, which usually can be found on the developer's website.  Some programs offer several types of scans, and you may want to run the most thorough type, usually called a <strong>full system scan</strong>.  This may take several hours.  Usually, you do not need to remain at the computer during the scan.</p>
              <p className="moreInfo">If no viruses or malware are found but you are still experiencing problems with your computer, try <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/computerbasics/basic-troubleshooting-techniques/1/">other troubleshooting techniques</a> or have your computer assessed by a support professional.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="Clicking run scan in a virus scanner" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/virus-scan.jpg" /></div>
              <h4>Review discovered threats and recommended action</h4>
              <p>Either during the course of the scan or when it's complete, the antivirus program will notify you of discovered threats and recommend various courses of action.  Usually, the recommended action for each threat is the best choice.  If the antivirus is unable to remove any threat, don't ignore it.  Investigate how to proceed with some Internet searches or by contacting a professional.  The support team for the antivirus program can often help you at this point.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/virus-scan-results.jpg" alt="Virus scan results" /></div>
              <h4>Malware</h4>
              <p>Your antivirus program may be bundled with an anti-malware program. If it isn't, you may want to install an anti-malware program and run a scan. This can help to find any malware your antivirus may have missed.  Antivirus and anti-malware programs scan for slightly different things but they work similarly, so you can follow the same steps in this tutorial.</p>
              <h4>If all else fails</h4>
              <p>If you are unable to remove the virus—or if your programs or operating system are damaged beyond repair—it may be necessary for you to erase the hard drive and reinstall your operating system and programs.  At this point, you may want to consider hiring a technical support professional, but it is still possible to do this yourself.  If you perform a full reformat of your hard drives during this process, it is almost guaranteed to eliminate even the most pernicious viruses, but all data on your drives will be lost.  This is one of many reasons it is crucial to <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/techsavvy/backing-up-your-files/1/">keep regular backups of your data</a> before your computer develops any significant problems.  If you restore data from backups after reformatting your hard drive, perform a virus scan on the restored data to be sure it is not infected with a virus.</p>

              <p>Trying to get your new printer up and running? Here are the basic steps you'll follow to set up almost any printer.</p>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li>
                  <p>Plug in the printer's <strong>power cable</strong> and make sure it's <strong>turned on</strong>.</p>

After you click the link, select <strong>File &gt; Print</strong> from your web browser's menu, or simply press <strong>Ctrl+P</strong> on your keyboard (or <strong>Command+P</strong> if you're on a Mac).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>A dialog box will appear. Locate and select the new printer from the list, then click <strong>Print</strong>.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The item will then be printed. But if it doesn't work, don't panic! You can try using some of the solutions to common problems below.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Solutions to common problems</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem: Nothing happens when you try to print.</strong> There are several reasons a printer might not work, even if everything's connected properly. First, you'll want to make sure you've put paper into the <strong>correct</strong><strong> tray</strong> and there's <strong>no paper stuck inside the printer</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem: The printer has paper and nothing's stuck, but it still won't print</strong>. If the solutions above don't work, try <strong>canceling the print job</strong> from the computer and trying again. Many printers also have a button you can use to restart the current job. If all else fails, try turning the printer off and on again to see if it fixes the problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem: The printer works, but the text is very light and difficult  to read</strong>. If this happens, it probably means your printer requires a new <strong>ink cartridge </strong>to keep working. The instruction manual included with the printer should note what type of cartridge you'll need to buy.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Advanced troubleshooting</h4>
              <p>If you're still having trouble, you can try to find help for your specific printer. We've collected a list of support pages for some of the most common printer brands below:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.brother-usa.com/Support">Brother</a></li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer">Canon</a></li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/SupportIndex.jsp">Epson</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Another idea would be to run a Google search describing your problem, including the brand and model number. In the example below, we're searching for <strong>canon</strong><strong> MX920 not responding</strong>.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="searching Google for a solution " src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/google.png" /></div>
              <h4>What about wireless printers?</h4>
              <p>The convenience of wireless printers has made them increasingly popular in recent years. Without the need to physically connect a printer to your computer, wireless printers make it easy to print from laptops, tablets, and even smartphones.</p>
              <p>Wireless printers can also be a little more difficult to set up than traditional USB printers, so we recommend carefully working through the instructions that came with your printer. If you're still having trouble, try using the tips above to find a solution that's specific to your printer.<br /></p>
              <p>That's all we've got—good luck with your new printer!<br /></p>

              <h3>How to power cycle a device</h3>
              <p>If you have a computer in your home, you probably have at least one other device that works alongside it, such as a modem, wireless router, or printer. These devices have a tendency to stop working from time to time, and it's not always immediately clear why.</p>
              <p>Before assuming anything is actually broken, you should try to run a <strong>power cycle</strong>. To do this, you'll want to turn the device off, then turn it back on. This will force it to <strong>reset</strong>, which can fix a lot of basic problems.</p>
              <p>Here are the steps to power cycle just about any device:</p>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Turn off</strong> and/or <strong>unplug</strong> the device.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img alt="unpluggint the device" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/powercycledevice_turnoff.png" width={750} /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wait at least <strong>30 seconds</strong>.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img alt="clock countdown timer" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/powercycledevice_wait30sec.png" width={750} /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Plug in the device and/or turn it back on. That's it—you just power cycled your device! With any luck, it should start working correctly. Keep in mind that if you're resetting an Internet device, such as a modem, it may take a minute or so to reconnect.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img alt="turning the device back on" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/powercycledevice_turnon.png" width={750} /></div>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p className="moreInfo">One other thing to note: If you're resetting devices that work together, like a modem and wireless router, you'll want to power cycle them at the same time.</p>
              <p>Running a power cycle won't fix more serious problems, but if you have a device that's not working correctly, it's a good thing to try first. If power cycling doesn't seem to help, you'll want to  do some more troubleshooting. Check out our lesson on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/computerbasics/15">basic troubleshooting techniques</a> to learn how.</p>

              <h3>Disable applications from running on startup</h3>
              <p>You may not realize it, but your computer runs several applications as soon as it starts. While this is necessary for your computer to function, too many applications running on startup can slow down your computer. Among other ways to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/basic-computer-skills/how-to-keep-an-old-computer-running-smoothly">keep your computer running smoothly</a>, you can disable applications from running on startup to improve its performance.  <br /></p>
              <h4>Consider before disabling anything</h4>
              <p>Before you disable an  application from starting, consider whether you should. You don't need to disable most applications, but disabling the ones you don't always need or ones that are demanding on your computer's resources can make a big difference.  If you use the program every day or if it's necessary for the operation of your computer, you should leave it enabled on startup. You can do an Internet search for the name of a program if you aren't sure what it is or what it does.<br /></p>
              <h4>Disable in a program's own settings</h4>
              <p>Some programs have a built-in setting to enable or disable them from running on startup. Each program is different, but it's usually in a settings or configuration menu. Many programs don't have a startup setting because most operating systems can automatically manage which programs run on startup.</p>
              <p className="centerImage"><img alt="Dropbox Preferences showing startup option" className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/dropbox preferences.png" /></p>
              <h4>Disable in Windows 8 and 10</h4>
              <p> In Windows 8 and 10, the <strong>Task Manager</strong> has a Startup tab to manage which applications run on startup. On most Windows computers, you can access the Task Manager by pressing <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Esc</strong>, then clicking the <strong>Startup</strong> tab. Select any program in the list and click the <strong>Disable</strong> button if you don't want it to run on startup.</p>
              <div className="centerImage"><img alt="Windows 8 Task Manager showing Startup tab" className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/task manager.png" /></div>
              <h4>Disable in Windows 7 and earlier</h4>
              <p>In Windows 7 and earlier, the process is a little more complicated. These settings are in the System Configuration utility, also known as <strong>msconfig</strong>.<br /></p>
              <ol>
                <li>Open the <strong>Start</strong> menu and locate the search box.  Note: If you're using Windows XP, click <strong>Run</strong> on the right side of the Start menu.</li>
                <li>
                  In either the search box or the Run dialog, type <strong>msconfig</strong> and press Enter.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" alt="Typing msconfig in the search box in the Start menu" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/searchformsconfig.png" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the <strong>System Configuration</strong> window, click the <strong>Startup</strong> tab. The check boxes to the left of each program name indicate if it runs on startup. Once you've changed the selections, click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img alt="The Startup tab in the System Configuration window." className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/msconfig cropped.png" /></div>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p className="attention">Unlike the Task Manager in newer versions of Windows, the System Configuration utility in older Windows versions can include essential Windows processes. Be sure you know what you're disabling, or you could damage your operating system!<br /></p>
              <h4> Disable in OS X</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Click the <strong>Apple</strong> icon in the top-left corner of the screen, then select <strong>System Preferences</strong>.

                </li>
                <li>
                  In the Users &amp; Groups window, click the <strong>Login Items</strong> tab. Select an application and click the minus button to remove it from the startup list, or click the plus button to add an application to the list if you want it to run on startup.

              <h3>How to keep an old computer running smoothly</h3>
              <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 800, height: 447}} alt="An old computer with gray hair and a cane" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/oldcomputer.png" width={800} height={447} /></div>
              <p>Being stuck with an old computer can be challenging. Unsupported operating systems are vulnerable to Internet threats, and the hardware of an older computer starts to face some limitations. However, there are a few things you can do to protect it and keep it running smoothly.    <br /></p>
              <h4>Secure your computer</h4>
              <p>Older versions of Windows, like Windows XP, no longer receive security updates from Microsoft. This leaves them vulnerable to many Internet dangers. You can protect your system by running up-to-date antivirus, antimalware, and firewall programs. Learn more in our lesson on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internetsafety/3">Protecting Your Computer from Internet Threats</a>.</p>
              <p>Using alternatives to Internet Explorer can also make your computer safer from Internet threats. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/chrome">Chrome</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/firefox">Firefox</a> are popular choices for browsing.</p>
              <p>If you're using Microsoft Outlook, you might want to consider switching to another email client like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>. Many Internet threats specifically target vulnerabilities in Outlook.</p>
              <h4>Consider upgrading your OS</h4>
              <p>One option for keeping your computer running smoothly and securely is upgrading to a newer OS, giving you access to current security updates and support. However, it will usually cost money, may require reformatting your hard drive, and might be confusing to use at first. Before upgrading, consider if it is worth these costs, and check to see if your computer is powerful enough to run the new OS.</p>
              <p>Alternately, you could install a lighter, free OS like Linux. Learning how to use Linux might take longer if you're accustomed to Windows, but it has many advantages and usually runs well on older computers. See our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/linux">Linux resources</a> for more information.</p>
              <h4>Maintain your computer</h4>
              <p>A few simple steps can extend the lifetime of your computer, keep your operating system running smoothly, and protect you from data loss. Think of these as good habits, like brushing your teeth every day or getting the oil changed in your car regularly.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Shut down your computer at least a few times a week, or every day.</li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/basic-computer-skills/uninstalling-software-from-your-windows-pc">Uninstall programs</a> you no longer use.</li>
                <li>Delete large files you no longer need, especially media files like movies, music, and images.</li>

                <li>Use a maintenance tool like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner">CCleaner</a>.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Back up your files</h4>
              <p>Older computers are more likely to experience hardware failure. Preparing for this possibility is much easier than recovering data from a failed drive. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/techsavvy/backing-up-your-files">Backing up your files</a> will protect you from losing your data. The two most common ways of doing this are copying your data to an external drive and using an online backup service.</p>

              <h3>Tips for speeding up your computer</h3>
              <div className="centerImage"><img src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/slowcomputer_introimage_v2.jpg" /></div>
              <p>A slow computer can be pretty frustrating and inconvenient. Whether you're stuck with an <a href="https://www.gcflearnfree.org/basic-computer-skills/how-to-keep-an-old-computer-running-smoothly/1/">old computer</a> or just want to get better performance out of a newer one, here are a few tips and fixes to get it running up to speed.</p>
              <h4>Freeing up disk space</h4>
              <p>In some cases, not having much space left on your disk drive can cause your computer to slow down. Here are a few quick ways you can free up some space:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>U</strong><strong>ninstall any unnecessary or unused software</strong>; many computers come with programs you might not use. <strong /></li>
                <li><strong>D</strong><strong>elete files </strong>you no longer need.</li>
                <li><strong>U</strong><strong>se an external storage</strong> for larger files and media.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>There are also some built-in tools that can help you free up even more space. On a Windows computer, you can use <strong>Disk Cleanup </strong>to get rid of temporary and unnecessary files, as shown in this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/diskclea.htm">Computer Hope article</a>. If you have a Mac with macOS Sierra or later, you can use the <strong>About This Mac</strong> dialog box to free up space, as shown in this <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206996">Apple support article</a>.<span className="redactor-invisible-space" /></p>
              <h4>Defragmenting your hard drive</h4>
              <p><a href="https://www.gcflearnfree.org/basic-computer-skills/how-to-defragment-your-hard-drive/1/">Defragmenting your hard drive</a> on a regular basis can often help speed up your computer as well. Over time, the data on your hard drive becomes fragmented, making it more difficult for your computer to find. Defragging reorganizes this data and allows your computer to access it more easily.</p>
              <h4>Adding more RAM</h4>
              <p>Another reason your computer might be running slowly is that it doesn't have enough <strong>RAM </strong>(<strong>random access memory</strong>). RAM is what allows your computer to have various programs open at the same time. If you don't have enough RAM, your computer will slow down quite a bit when you have too many programs running.</p>
              <p>Luckily, it's possible to <strong>add more RAM</strong> to your computer. To do this, you'll need to figure out what type of RAM your computer uses. After you buy the RAM, you'll have to physically open your computer to install it. If this process sounds too complicated, you may want to consider taking it to a computer repair shop to have someone else do it. <br /></p>
              <h4>Updating your drivers</h4>
              <p>Every device connected to your computer, whether it be a keyboard, printer, or mouse, requires something called a <strong>driver</strong> to function. Drivers are basically <strong>programs that tell your computer how to use these devices</strong>. If these drivers are out of date, they can slow down your computer and prevent these devices from functioning properly. If this happens, they need to be updated.</p>
              <p>If you're using a Windows computer, your drivers will most likely be updated automatically. However, there may be cases where you need to manually do this. Check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214">this guide</a> from Lifewire to learn how to update them. If you have a Mac, all of your drivers will update on their own.</p>
              <h4>Managing startup processes</h4>
              <p>If your computer is taking a long time to boot up, there may be too many programs launching during startup. Luckily there's a way to <strong>manage these startup processes</strong> and control what will and won't launch. For information on how to do this, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/162446/how-to-manage-startup-applications-in-windows-8/">this guide from How-To Geek</a> for Windows computers or <a target="_blank" href="https://nektony.com/blog/mac-startup-items">this guide from Nektony</a> for Macs.</p>
              <p className="moreInfo">Before disabling certain apps and programs, be sure to do some research and make sure they're not vital for your computer to run. <br /></p>
              <h4>Checking for viruses and spyware</h4>
              <p>Throughout the course of using your computer, it may accidentally acquire malware or viruses. These often damage and slow down your computer. The best way to prevent and deal with them is to use some sort of <strong>antivirus software</strong>. Most of these can scan for, detect, and in some cases eliminate them.

              <h3>How to defragment your hard drive</h3>
              <p>As a computer owner, there are several steps you'll want to take to ensure it is running up to speed. One of these steps is <strong>defragmenting</strong> (or <strong>defragging</strong>) your hard drive. In this lesson, we'll show you the basics of <strong>defragging</strong>.</p>
              <p className="moreInfo">This lesson will focus on Windows. If you have a Mac, you won't need to defrag your hard drive.</p>
              <h4>What is defragging?</h4>
              <p>Imagine that all of the information on your hard drive is a load of laundry. There are lots of different types of clothing and colors, and they all get mixed together in the wash.  All of your clothes are still there, but they're jumbled together and take up a lot of space. This is similar to what happens over time to the data on your hard drive.  Everything gets moved around and separated (or <strong>fragmented</strong>) and your computer has to work harder to find everything it needs.</p>
              <p>When you finish doing the laundry, you usually sort your clothing back into organized piles so they can go back into your closet or dresser.  When you <strong>defrag</strong> your hard drive, your computer is doing something similar.  It's taking all of the data and reorganizing it so your computer can find things more easily and make the most of its available space.<br /></p>
              <h4>Why defrag?</h4>
              <p>Defragging your computer can both solve and prevent a number of problems. If you don't regularly defrag your hard drive, your computer may run slowly and/or may take a long time to start up after you turn it on. If a hard drive is too fragmented, your computer may freeze up or not start at all.</p>
              <h4>How to defrag your hard drive:</h4>
              <p>If you have Windows 7 or newer, your computer automatically defrags your hard drive on a scheduled  weekly basis. Accessing and changing this schedule is easy to do.</p>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li>
                  In the <strong>Start menu</strong>'s search bar, type <strong>defragment</strong>, then click <strong>Defragment and Optimize Drives</strong>.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/2016-08-03_08-41-59.png" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <strong>Optimize Drives </strong>menu will appear. At the bottom, it will show you how often your hard drive is scheduled to be defragged.  The <strong>Change settings</strong> button on the right will let you change the schedule settings if you want your hard drive to be defragged more or less frequently.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/2016-08-04_13-17-27.jpg" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you find that your hard drive is not being defragged automatically, you can also manually defrag it. Select the drive you want to defrag, then click the <strong>Optimize </strong>button. The process of defragging can take a long time, so you may want to let it run overnight or during a time when you don't need to use your computer.

              <h3>Starting a computer in safe mode</h3>
              <p><strong>Safe mode</strong> is an alternate way of starting up your computer so it's only using the essential programs needed to run. Normally, when you boot up your computer, it loads a lot of <strong>drivers</strong>, which are programs that allow your <strong>operating system (OS) to communicate with other devices and software</strong>. However, when you start up in safe mode, only the minimum number of  drivers needed to run the computer are loaded (usually just the mouse, keyboard, and display drivers).</p>
              <h4>Why use safe mode?</h4>
              <p>Let's say one day you go to use your computer and find that your <strong />OS just won't start,<strong /> or maybe it keeps crashing on you. This could be due to any number of reasons, including a <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internetsafety/what-to-do-if-your-computer-gets-a-virus/1/">virus</a>, <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/internetsafety/how-to-avoid-malware/1/">malware</a>, corrupt files, or something else entirely. Safe mode allows  you to boot up your OS in a very basic state so you can potentially <strong>identify and fix the problem</strong>. <br /></p>
              <p className="moreInfo">While in safe mode, your <strong>screen resolution may look a bit off</strong>, certain <strong>applications might not work properly</strong>, or your computer may <strong>run a bit slower than usual</strong>. This is completely normal; it's just the effects of certain drivers not running.</p>
              <h4>To start in safe mode (Windows 8.1 and later):</h4>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li>
                  Click the <strong>Start button </strong>and select the <strong>Power</strong> icon.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/newer_start.jpg" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hold down the <strong>Shift</strong> key and click <strong>Restart</strong>.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/newer_restart_shift.jpg" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  A menu will appear. Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong>.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/newer_startup_settings.png" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Click the <strong>Restart button</strong>.
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/newer_settings_restart.png" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your computer will reboot, presenting you with the menu shown below. Press <strong>4</strong> to select <strong>Enable Safe Mode</strong> (or <strong>5</strong> to select <strong>Enable Safe Mode with Networking</strong> if you need to use the Internet).
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/newer_enable_safe_mode.png" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>Your computer will then boot in safe mode.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>To start in safe mode (Windows 7 and earlier):</h4>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li><strong>Turn on</strong> or <strong>restart</strong> your computer. While it's booting up, hold down the <strong>F8 key before the Windows logo appears</strong>.</li>
                <li>A menu will appear. You can then release the F8 key. Use the arrow keys to highlight <strong>Safe Mode</strong> (or <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> if you need to use the Internet to solve your problem), then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
                <li>Your computer will then boot in safe mode.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>To start in safe mode on a Mac:</h4>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li><strong>Turn on</strong> or <strong>restart</strong> your computer. While it's booting up, hold down the <strong>Shift key before the Apple logo appears</strong>. Once the logo appears, you can release the Shift key.</li>
                <li>Your computer will then boot in safe mode.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>What to do once you're in safe mode</h4>
              <p>Certain problems can be fixed pretty easily using safe mode, while others may prove to be more of a challenge.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If you think it's <strong>malware </strong>that's affecting your computer, you can easily <strong>run an antivirus application to try and remove it</strong>. This task might be difficult to do while running your computer normally.</li>
                <li>If you've recently <strong>installed a program</strong> and notice that your computer has been acting strange since then, you can run safe mode to <strong>uninstall it</strong>.</li>
                <li>If you suspect your <strong>drivers</strong> are making your system unstable, you can use safe mode to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214">update them</a>.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="moreInfo">If you boot up with safe mode and your computer <strong>continues to crash</strong>, this means there's probably <strong>something wrong with your hardware</strong>. If this is the case, you'll probably need to take it to a repair technician for further help.</p>
              <p>Once you think you've solved your problem, you'll need to get out of safe mode to test and see if it worked. To do this, simply <strong>restart your computer</strong>. When it boots up again, it should start Windows in its normal operating mode. <br /></p>

              <h3>Installing software on your Windows PC</h3>
              <p>Your computer allows you to do some really amazing things. Digital photo editing, sophisticated computer gaming, video streaming—all of these things are possible because of different types of <strong>software</strong>. Developers are always creating new software applications, which allow you to do even more with your computer.</p>
              <h4>Installing from a CD-ROM</h4>
              <p>From the mid-1990s through the late 2000s, the most common way to get new software was to purchase a CD-ROM. You could then insert the disc, and the computer would walk you through the installation.</p>
              <p>Now, almost all software has moved away from this model. Many new computers no longer include a CD-ROM for this reason. However, if you do need to install software from a CD-ROM, simply insert the disc into your computer, then follow the instructions.</p>
              <h4>Installing software from the Web</h4>
              <p>Today, the most common way to get new software is to <strong>download it</strong> from the Internet. Applications like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop can now be purchased and downloaded right to your computer. You can also install free software this way. For example, if you wanted to install the Google Chrome web browser, you can visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser">this page</a> and click the Download button.</p>
              <p>The installation file will be saved to your computer in <strong>.exe format</strong>. Pronounced <strong>dot e-x-e</strong>, this is the standard extension for installation files on Windows computers. You can follow the steps below to install an application from an .exe file.</p>
              <ol className="numbered-list">
                <li>
                  <p>Locate and download an <strong>.exe</strong> file.</p>
                  <div className="centerImage"><img style={{width: 655, height: 275}} className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/download.png" alt="downloading an .exe file" width={655} height={275} /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Locate and <strong>double-click</strong> the .exe file. (It will usually be in your <strong>Downloads</strong> folder.)</p>
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/run.png" alt="opening the .exe file" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>A dialog box will appear. Follow the instructions to install the software.</p>
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/install.png" alt="installing the application" /></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The software will be installed. You can now open the application from the <strong>Start menu</strong> (Windows 7) or the <strong>Start Screen</strong> (Windows 8).</p>
                  <div className="centerImage"><img className="imageBorder" src="./Basic Computer Skills_ What is a PDF File__files/startscreen.png" alt="opening the application" /></div>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Tips for finding software</h4>
              <p>In our experience, the easiest way to find new software is to <strong>search the Web</strong>. For example, if you were looking for a way to edit some personal photos on your computer, you could run a Google search for<strong> free photo-editing software</strong>. If you're not exactly sure what kind of software you're looking for, try describing the tasks you want to complete. For example, if you wanted a way to create to-do lists and organize your appointments, you might search for something like <strong>free calendar organizer software</strong>.</p>
              <h4>The Windows Store</h4>
              <p>If you're using Windows 8, you can download and install software from the <strong>Windows Store</strong>. The Windows Store is meant to simplify the process of locating and installing software from third-party developers—when you find an app in the Windows store, you won't have to do any extra work to install it.</p>

              <p className="attention">There are some applications that can't be removed this way. To completely uninstall an application like this, you'll need to locate and delete its <strong>Library</strong> files.
